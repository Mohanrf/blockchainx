            <p>Modern technology removes the interpretation of third-party control to avoid the complexity and risk behind traditional identity management systems. It helps maintain a user's ownership, thereby introducing precedents for self-ownership and control of their private data. </p>
  
            <h2>How do decentralized identities work?</h2>
            <p>
                Decentralized Identity works with the blockchain to give sovereign control over digital identities to users themselves. Blockchain ensures that users control their digital identities without governments, big tech companies, or other commercial entities acting as intermediaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                The role of decentralized identity in the financial sector is attracting new attention. In this sector, users have limited control over the security, sharing, and accessibility of their data through the interpretation of third-party agencies. Data in decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials are completely indestructible or immutable, thereby removing control from centralized intermediaries.
            </p>
            <p>
