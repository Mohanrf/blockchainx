          <h1>ERC1155 – Explore the ERC-1155 Token Standard</h1>
          <p>
            If you understand what an
            <a [routerLink]="['/non-fungible-token-development']"> NFT</a>
            is and that the abbreviation of "Non-fungible token" no longer
            confuses you, you are ready to delve deeper, which is necessary
            before learning about ERC-1155.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address these concerns, the ERC-1155 standard was created, which
            can function as both a fungible and non-fungible token. The ERC-1155
            standard allows you to mint and deploy an infinite number of tokens
            under a single smart contract, reducing network congestion and gas
            fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, we will define the ERC-1155 token standard and examine its
            benefits and advantages.
          </p>

          <h2>What is ERC-1155 ?</h2>
          <div class="blog-image py-3">

            ERC stands for "Ethereum Request for Comments." It is a type of EIP
            that focuses on Ethereum application standards, which include
            tokens. Tokens are generally classified as either fungible or
            non-fungible. Fungible tokens, like dollar bills or pesos, are
            interchangeable. Non-fungible tokens, like a painting or a book, are
            unique and non-transferable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even before ERC-1155, the two most common token standards for
            fungible tokens were
            <a [routerLink]="['/erc20-token-development']">ERC-20</a>
            and ERC-721 for non-fungible tokens. They couldn't (and still can't)
            be wrapped up in the same smart contract. Because of this
            limitation, if someone wanted to transfer a USDC (ERC-20) and a
            CryptoKitties NFT (ERC-721), they would have to execute multiple
            transactions, which was inefficient and costly.
          </p>
          <p>
            ERC-1155 addresses this issue by combining the two token standards.
            The ERC-1155 token standard allows for the efficient transfer of
            fungible and non-fungible tokens in a single transaction.
          </p>

          <h2>How does ERC-1155 work ?</h2>
          <div class="blog-image py-3">
            <img
              class="img-fluid"
              src="assets-new/images/blog/erc-inside2.jpg"
              alt="How-ERC-1155-Works"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            The initial motivation for ERC-1155 was to address issues
            confronting blockchain game developers and players. There are
            numerous examples of ERC-1155 being used in applications other than
            gaming. Gaming, on the other hand, is a great reference use case for
            understanding how ERC-1155 works.
          </p>
          <p>
            Massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) contain tens of thousands
            of items—armor, weapons, shields, skins, coins, badges, castles, and
            so on—that players can collect and trade with one another. Some
            items, such as coins, are fungible, while others, such as a sword,
            are not. Each of these items is a token on the blockchain. Each item
            necessitates its own smart contract. That's 100,000 smart contracts
            in a game with 100,000 items!
          </p>
          <p>
            Multiple items can be stored in a single smart contract using an
            ERC-1155 token, and any number of items can be sent to one or more
            recipients in a single transaction. This means you could send a
            sword to one friend, a shield to another, and 100 gold coins to both
            in a single transaction.
          </p>

          <h2>What makes ERC-1155 so unique?</h2>
          <p>
            ERC-1155 has a number of unique characteristics, including the
            ability to transfer multiple token types at once, resulting in
            increased efficiency and lower transaction costs.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2">
            <i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> In contrast to ERC-20 and ERC-721,
            which require a new smart contract for each type of token, it
            supports an infinite number of tokens.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2">
            <i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> It supports semi-fungible tokens in
            addition to fungible and non-fungible tokens. Semi-fungible tokens
            function similarly to general-admission concert tickets. They are
            interchangeable and can be purchased for money prior to the show
            (fungible). However, they lose their pre-show value and become
            collectibles after the show (non-fungible).
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2">
            <i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> It has a safe transfer function,
            unlike ERC-20 and ERC-1155, which allow tokens to be reclaimed if
            they are sent to the wrong address.
          </p>

          <h2>Who uses ERC-1155?</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Enjin </strong>- Enjin provides a variety of blockchain
            products, many of which use ERC-1155.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Horizon</strong> - Horizon is a blockchain game company that
            uses ERC-1155 in its Skyweaver game.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>OpenSea</strong> - The ERC-1155 implementation of the NFT
            marketplace allows multiple creators per smart contract, but only
            one creator can mint more copies.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>OpenZeppelin</strong> - The ERC-1155 standard is used by
            OpenZeppelin's blockchain security products.
          </p>

          <h2>The Benefits of the ERC-1155 token standard</h2>
          <h4>1. Token transfers in batches</h4>
          <p>
            As previously stated, the ERC-1155 token standard was the first to
            successfully implement batch token transfers. Users can transact an
            infinite number of tokens using a single
            <a [routerLink]="['/bridge-smart-contract-development']"
              >smart contract</a
            >, reducing network congestion and saving money on gas fees.
          </p>
          <h4>2. Token with multiple functions</h4>
          <p>
            While ERC-20 is an excellent currency standard, and ERC-721 is the
            definitive non-fungible standard, the two do not get along. ERC-1155
            tokens, on the other hand, can function as both and even convert
            from one to the other. This means that a single smart contract can
            handle both types of tokens at the same time.
          </p>
          <h4>3. External metadata that is more efficient</h4>
          <p>
            The ERC-1155 standard also removes metadata from the contract and
            replaces it with a JSON file. The metadata also removes some
            obsolete and legacy fields, transferring much of the data from the
            smart contract to JSON. While this only saves a small amount of data
            per file, it saves a significant amount of congestion on the
            <a [routerLink]="['']">blockchain</a> as a whole.
          </p>
          <h4>4. Integrated transaction validation</h4>
          <p>
            One of the issues with some legacy smart contracts is that there
            will be uncertainty about telling what will happen if something goes
            wrong. The Enjin team has ensured that no coin or asset will be lost
            if an incorrect address is entered or there is a mistake elsewhere
            in the contract with ERC-1155. The standard adds a built-in function
            that validates transactions before executing them.
          </p>

          <h2>The Primary Advantages of ERC-1155</h2>
          <p>
            Now that you know what the ERC-1155 standards are, let's take a look
            at some of the main advantages of ERC-1155:
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2">
            <i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> Allows the use of NFTs, fungible
            tokens, and semi-fungible tokens.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2">
            <i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> Increased level of security

          <p class="pb-2">
            <i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> Metadata that changes over time
          </p>

          <h2>The Future of ERC-1155</h2>
          <p>
            Despite the fact that ERC-1155 has been around for four years, it is
            still underutilized in comparison to its ERC-20 and ERC-721
            counterparts. Given ERC-1155's versatility, this may come as a
            surprise; it's possible that existing non-ERC-1155 projects will
            migrate to the new standard in order to expand their functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            ERC-1155 will be used in Ethereum-based blockchain games in the
            future. The advent of play-to-earn games may hasten this process.
          </p>

          <h2>In the end</h2>
          <p>
            The growth of fungible and non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum
            blockchain has resulted in numerous protocols and standards for
            each. ERC-20 and ERC-721 are the standards for fungible and
            non-fungible tokens, respectively. It comes at a high cost, however,
            because they are not interchangeable or compatible. As a result of
            these issues, a new standard, ERC-1155, was developed.. However,
            NFTs and other fungible tokens can now share a smart contract with
            this new and more powerful standard in the meantime.
