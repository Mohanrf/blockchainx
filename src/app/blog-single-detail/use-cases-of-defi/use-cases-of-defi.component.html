          <h1>Major Use Cases of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) - BlockchainX</h1>

          <p>
            DeFi is the new contender in the fintech space and is gaining a
            tremendous amount of traction. The term DeFi means Decentralized
            Finance and is grabbing a lot of attention from several
            entrepreneurs. The reason is that the idea revolves around sectors
            such as banking, financial services, and insurance and brings a lot
            of benefits to the table. DeFi looks to revolutionize the way we
            look at finance by decentralizing financial functions, primarily
            lending and borrowing, and making it universally accessible. This
            involves eliminating the intermediaries such as banks and financial
            institutions and leveraging the automation to perform direct
            financial transactions among the participants. At first glance, you
            will find that it seems similar to existing financial solutions that
            work on blockchain technology. If so, why are more and more players
            basing their projects on it? Why are big names in the game like
            Binance and Coinbase creating a space for DeFi on their platforms
            and promoting it to the users? Is it just the same product in new
            packaging, or is there something revolutionary about the idea? Let’s
            dig a little deeper and find out.
          </p>

          <h2>What is Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?</h2>
          <p>
            DeFi stands for "Decentralized Finance." It is an ecosystem for
            financial functions built to define investing, borrowing, lending,
            trading, and other financial services based on a decentralized
            infrastructure. If you would like to learn about the basics of DeFi,
            we recommend reading our article on
            <a

            using open-source software on decentralized networks to build and
            maintain transparency and trust within the framework.
          </p>

          <p>
            The system has generated significant results, yielding comprehensive
            revenue ever since has hit the market. The combined value in DeFi
            contracts has increased dramatically from US$ 2.1 million in
            September 2017 to US$6.9 billion in August 2020. It has further
            risen by US$2.9 billion since August 2020.
          </p>

          <h2>What Problems Does Decentralized Finance Solve?</h2>
          <p>
            The major benefit of decentralizing financial services is that it
            enables universal access to everyone around the world. . Even today,
            large populations in third-world countries lack access to
            traditional financial services.
          </p>

          <h4>1. Inequality in Finance.</h4>
          <p>
            As we spoke about earlier, one of the major problems in the
            financial sector today is inequality in receiving financial
            services. For some of us, living in developed or developing
            countries, availing of loans might not be as difficult as it was a
            decade ago. However, there are populations in countries around the
            world that have access to smartphones and the internet but not to
            financial services like loans or bank accounts. DeFi tries to solve
            this problem by building a systematic ecosystem on decentralized
            networks where users can avail themselves of various financial
            services through just a smartphone and internet connection.
          </p>

          <h4>2. Financial Censorship.</h4>

          <p>
            Censorship of financial assets is something that most of us would
            have some experience with. In centralized financial systems, the
            users have no ownership of their assets. Financial institutions and
            Governments have the power to restrict user's access to their own
            money. They often put restrictions on the amount of money one can
            withdraw at a particular time and the number of times in a day they
            can do it. Banks even change service charges from customers for
            withdrawing money from their accounts.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a system at play here, and one where the big players
            sitting in the rolling chairs of central authorities control what
            happens to a customer’s assets. Governments, banks, and
            intermediaries can freeze any company or individual’s assets at
            their sole discretion.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the financial services in a DeFi system are not under the
            control of any central authority or institution. Hence, no one can
            deny you access to your assets.
          </p>

          <h2>What Are The Use Cases For DeFi?</h2>
          <p>
            Such innovative approaches to finance give Decentralized Finance the
            potential to revolutionize the global financial system. Let's
            understand some of the use cases for DeFi:
          </p>

          <h4>1. Payments</h4>
          <p>
            Decentralized Finance implements blockchain-based protocols through
            its applications. With this, users can make instant payments from
            their wallets which are often cheaper than other systems. These
            applications also provide exclusive discounts to users, persuading
            them to continually use the platform.
          </p>

          <h4>2. Borrowing and Lending</h4>

          <p>
            There are a lot of Red Tape laws and restrictions for borrowing and
            lending functions. . However, Decentralized Finance provides users
            universal access to these
            <a
              [routerLink]="['/blockchain-lending-software-using-defi']"
              class="content-link"
              ><b>DeFi Lending and Borrowing Platforms</b></a
            >, often only asking for collateral in cryptocurrency.
          </p>
          <h4>It includes:</h4>
          <p>i. Quick transaction settlements</p>
          <p>
            ii. Allows for backing up of digital assets with real-life assets.
          </p>
          <p>
            iii. Does not require credit checks and offers access to all users.
          </p>
          <p>
            iv. Keeps the options open for borrowers and lenders because they
            can choose from a wide number of users to transact with,
            democratizing the process.
          </p>

          <h4>3. Stablecoins</h4>
          <p>
            As the name suggests, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are
            pegged to fiat currencies such as the US Dollar. These coins are
            used to create stability. These assets dodge the typical price
            swings with cryptocurrencies and are suitable to use as mediums of
            exchange and to store value. Stablecoins are a sustainable solution
            as compared to traditional cryptocurrencies, which are not
            functional units of an account owing to their volatility.
          </p>

          <h4>4. Tokenization</h4>

          <p>
            Tokenization connects
            <a
              [routerLink]="['/crypto-currency-development']"
              class="content-link"
              ><b>cryptocurrency tokens</b></a
            >
            with real-world assets. Simply put, tokenization creates
            asset-backed tokens to elevate its liquidity in the market. This
            process can accelerate the place of assets with low liquidity such
            as jewelry, real estate, and art, in the market. It also allows us
            to divide these assets into portions where investors can buy parts
            of the asset, instead of the whole thing. What this does is that it
            allows low-income earners to invest in products or services that
            previously were out of reach because of the high prices.
          </p>

          <h4>5. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes)</h4>
          <p>
            <a
              [routerLink]="['/cryptocurrency-exchange-software-development']"
              class="content-link"
              ><b>Decentralized Exchanges</b></a
            >
            or DEXes are platforms where users can make peer-to-peer
            transactions in an automated manner. This way, users don’t have to
            depend on third-party exchanges. Moreover, newer, inexperienced
            users can trade coins without any complicated processes.
          </p>

          <h4>6. Issuance Platforms</h4>
          <p>
            These platforms automate the process of tokenization and provide
            users with easy-to-use tools to create digital tokens and tokenize
            their assets. The issuance platform provides users with the
            technical and legal infrastructure and takes a lot of the complexity
            out of the process. Individuals and companies can seamlessly raise
            funds through the tokenization process, using simple and easy-to-use
            user-interfaces. This also eliminates the need to rely on
            intermediaries such as banks, credit unions, lawyers, etc.
          </p>

          <h4>7. Open Marketplaces</h4>
          <p>
            The open marketplaces eliminate the need for central authorities for
            transactions. By eliminating market dominance by central
            authorities, Decentralized Finance opens the doors for a
            user-centric market where free trade is encouraged. Users can now
            trade non-fungible tokens such as trading cards, collectibles, game
            items, etc. through blockchain-based smart contracts.
          </p>

          <h4>8. Prediction Markets</h4>
          <p>
            Prediction markets are essentially betting arenas where users bet on
            the future outcomes of game nights, elections, weather, natural
            disasters, commodity prices, and other significant events.
            Decentralized Finance democratizes prediction markers by providing
            universal participation. This means that users can take part in
            betting events without the approval of any centralized authority. A
            user can place bets on an event of their choice from any part of the
            world.
          </p>

          <h4>9. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)</h4>
          <p>
            Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are decentralized bodies that
            use blockchain frameworks and
            <a
              [routerLink]="['/smart-contract-development']"
              class="content-link"
              ><b>smart contracts</b></a
            >
            for automated decision making. They solve problems like corruption
            by maintaining the highest level of transparency where all the
            criteria and bylaws for decision-making are coded into smart
            contracts. This makes the entire process seamless, needing little to
            no human input.
          </p>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>
            Decentralized Finance is creating a secure and transparent financial
            ecosystem that provides universal participation.
          </p>

            and true decentralization, DeFi systems have proven to be the most
            influential disruptors of the global financial markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            DeFi also acts as the foundation for many more projects to come in a
            truly decentralized market that can act as a democratized platform
            for populations around the world, especially in third-world
            countries.
