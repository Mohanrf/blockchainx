          <h1>4 Types of Blockchain You Should Know About</h1>

          <p>
            Blockchain has caused quite a buzz in the technological world.
            Although its first-ever application — Bitcoin — came to existence in
            2009, it didn’t skyrocket to fame until late 2017 when its value
            increased from mere 1000s to almost $20000 per Bitcoin. The
            rollercoaster ride of bitcoin, in turn, shone brightly upon its
            architecture — Blockchain. The technology was widely studied and
            adopted worldwide that almost everyone knows what Blockchain means
            and where it can be applied to improve the industries. But there is
            a catch. The definition of Blockchain differs according to the type
            of Blockchain we are discussing. So we have put together all the
            types of Blockchain in the blog for your perusal.
          </p>

          <h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>

          <p>
            Blockchain is a distributed, decentralized, and immutable data
            structure for data storage. It is a chain of blocks, where every
            block comprises a collection of data. The technology is made up of a
            network of computational devices with which data can enter the
            blockchain to be stored as blocks. But not every device can generate
            a block. The algorithm generates a puzzle, and whichever device
            solves the puzzle first will get the rights to generate a block
            after its proof of work is verified by more than 50 percent of the
            devices connected to the network.
          </p>

          <h2>Public Blockchain</h2>
          <p>
            Public Blockchain is the typical blockchain definition we see widely
            on the internet. As the name suggests, it is open to everyone. Any
            machine can sign in and become a part of the Blockchain network with
            ease. And any machine connected to the network can view the data
            (usually transactions), history of storage, and IDs involved in the
            stored data. But that’s alright because there is no way to identify
            the person behind an ID unless the user reveals it himself. Bitcoin
            and Ethereum are some of the famous cryptocurrencies using public
            Blockchain.
          </p>

          <h2>Private Blockchain</h2>
          <p>
            Not everyone can connect to a Private Blockchain as it is comprised
            of a closed network and restricts the public from connecting to it.
            Only the administrator of the Blockchain can allow devices to become
            a part of the private Blockchain. The administrator can further
            control the accessibility, authorizations, and permissions of the
            members of the network. Private Blockchain is handy when companies
            want to leverage the advantages of Blockchain to reduce transaction
            costs and to protect their data integrity but with control over the
            transparency.
          </p>

          <h2>Hybrid Blockchain</h2>

          <p>
            Hybrid Blockchain is a combination of public and private Blockchain.
            It makes use of the both the algortithms to increase the security of
            the network. In hybrid Blockchain, the data stored can either
            allowed to be seen by all the machines in the network, or it can
            also be shielded from the view of the public. That is, you can
            control who sees the data and who don’t. For example, a real estate
            company can allow its customers to see the details of their
            respective projects, but not the other projects of the company.
          </p>

          <h2>Federated Blockchain</h2>
          <p>
            Consortium or Federated Blockchain is a semi-decentralized
            Blockchain network managed by selected organizations. Unlike private
            Blockchain where the network comprises nodes of one organization,
            consortium Blockchain is managed by multiple organizations.
            Consortium Blockchain is the ideal for the use of banks and
            government organizations where they can store and share confidential
            information.
          </p>

          <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

          <p>
            Blockchain is still a developing technology. There is more room for
            innovation, and more types of Blockchain networks can surface in no
            time. What we have jotted above is, at present, mostly used types
            Blockchain and experimented on. If you want to build a Blockchain
            networks, or exchanges, or wallets, or DApps, or ICOs/STOs, or even
            custom Blockchain solutions, we can build it for you. Before that,
            we recommend you to analyze your options and arrive at the optimal
            solution for your business. You can also get in touch with our
