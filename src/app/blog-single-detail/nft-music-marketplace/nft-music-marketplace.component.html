            for fans. But before we dive into this burgeoning blockchain music
            ecosystem, let's clear up some of the mysteries surrounding music
            NFTs. For that be fully aware of what these static music NFTs are
            all about. Without further ado let's get to the topic.
          </p>

          <h2>What are Music NFTs?</h2>
          <p>
            A non-fungible token is a digital asset that can be bought and sold
            on a blockchain. It is tied to a physical entity and represents the
            value of the entity in digital tokens/currency. Most NFTs in the
            market are for digital arts and games but also include a lively
            selection of music tracks, singles, albums, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            NFTs can apply in many fields and the music sector is one of them.
            Music NFTs are the new wave in the NFT category and can be bought,
            collected, sold, and shared. A key difference you should be aware of
            in music NFTs between buying a music track online and an NFT is
            ownership.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you buy iTunes, you only get the right to listen to it, but when
            you buy music NFT, you get the ownership right along with the
            listening right. The additional benefit of buying musical NFTs is
            that you can sell them to third parties and earn money from them.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-left">Types of Music NFTs</h2>
          <p>
            Different types of music NFT drops are discussed here, each with
            different levels of exclusivity.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2">
            <i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> 1/1 (one of one) NFTs: NFTs issued as
            a single or unique item are called 1/1 or (one of one) NFTs. From
            this perspective, it is completely exclusive. Such NFTs are like
            real-life paintings, only one of which exists. Due to their rarity,
            1/1s usually command a much higher price than regular NFT versions.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2">
            <i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> Open Edition: This is another type of
            NFT that can mint unlimited editions. However, don't confuse "open"
            with "unlimited". Many open editions are only available to the mint
            for set periods. After the time finishes, no new NFTs can be
            printed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> Limited Editions: A limited-edition
            NFT is limited to a predetermined number of versions. In other
            words, the limited number of NFTs available for minting are called
            limited editions. Many such collections contain over 10,000
            editions.
          </p>

          <h2>Benefits of Music NFTs for Artists</h2>
          <p>
            The selling price of music NFTs from the
            <a [routerLink]="['/nft-marketplace-development']"
              >music NFT marketplace</a
            >
            goes directly to the artist. From the stated selling price, the NFT
            marketplace only charges network fees. These offer great advancement
            to artists. This is a big change from the traditional method where
            proceeds from sales go to music houses and then a portion of the
            amount is paid to the musician as royalty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Artists can take advantage of new methods of distribution and use of
            technology in the music industry as they look from old to new. On
            the other hand, music artists face several critical issues related
            to controlling ownership of their work. Moreover, music artists have
            always experienced problems in managing the monetization aspect of
            their art. To overcome such problems NFTs are a great choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the help of NFTs, artists can regain control over their work.
            The growing focus on music NFT projects provides great opportunities
            for artists to create music that their fans will love.
          </p>
          <p>
            Music NFTs not only provides a great opportunity to bring power back
            to the artists of the music we love. Through
            <a [routerLink]="['']">Web3 community development</a>, they create
            entire worlds around these artists. Through NFTs, we can create a
            more equitable model for prosperity, a large part of which will be
            through community ownership.
          </p>

          <h2>How can you buy Music NFTs?</h2>
          <p>Here we briefly explain how you can buy music NFTs.</p>
          <p>
            The foremost step you want to follow when buying any NFTs is to get
            a crypto wallet. If you are interested in this field, you should
            already complete this step.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once this step is over, you need to fund with well and reliable
            crypto. After buying your crypto and transferring it to the wallet,
            you need to decide which marketplace platform you want to start your
            musical NFT collecting journey with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, it's time to mint or buy your music NFTs. Once you find a
            music NFT that you want to buy, you don't necessarily have to buy it
            directly. For that, you will interact with a smart contract to pay a
            certain amount to mint (create) an NFT which will be sent directly
            to your wallet. In other cases, you are buying an already prepared
            NFT that is part of a collection. These two are almost the same
            thing.
          </p>

          <h2>Music NFT Marketplace</h2>
          <p>
            NFTs, give the permission to artists and musicians more control over
            their works. They can sell directly to their fans, shortening the
            distribution chain. A few marketplaces/platforms have been created
            for artists to generate NFTs for their works and sell them on the
            blockchain. Now that you have learned how to buy music NFTs, let's
            see where to buy them.
