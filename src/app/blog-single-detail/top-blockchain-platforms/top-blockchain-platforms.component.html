          </p>
          <h4>Greater transparency</h4>
          <p>
            Transparency has become an important factor in businesses gaining
            the trust of their customers. Through the distributed ledger,
            blockchain enables an application or system to improve its data
            processing and thus increase transparency. Typically, distributed
            ledgers are open to the public. It allows transactions after users
            are verified using pre-defined protocols. As a result, blockchain
            improves the application's transparency.
          </p>

          <h4>Outstanding tamper proofing</h4>
          <p>
            As previously stated, tampering with the data or transactions on the
            blockchain is not possible. Any changes to the blockchain network
            will be visible to all participants immediately. Thus, no network
            change will go unnoticed. Many organizations collaborate with a
            dedicated blockchain development company to incorporate this feature
            into their solutions.
          </p>

          <h4>Drastic Increase in Efficiency</h4>
          <p>
            Since blockchain is a decentralized and distributed technology, it
            improves system efficiency. It has aided companies in increasing the
            speed and efficiency of their operations, products, and services.

          <h2>How to Choose the Best Blockchain platforms?</h2>
          <img
            src="assets-new/images/blog/platform.png"
            alt="How to Choose the Best Blockchain platforms?"
            class="img-fluid mb-4"
            width="100%"
            height="100%"
            loading="lazy"
          />
          <p>
            Since blockchain is a complex and advanced-scale technology, its
            reliability and quality performance are determined by a number of
            factors. The following are the factors to consider when choosing the
            top blockchain platforms in 2023:
          </p>

          <h4>Speed</h4>
          <p>
            The number of transactions that a blockchain platform can handle in
            a second is determined by its speed. It is known as TPS
            (transactions per second). The more transactions a platform can
            handle, the faster it will work.
          </p>

          <h4>Functionality</h4>
          <p>
            Blockchain development is a broad field. There are differences in
            the platform's functionality and working process. Each blockchain
            platform serves a specific purpose, so you must select one based on
            your requirements.
          </p>

          <h4>Security</h4>
          <p>
            Blockchain has advanced security features. This is because
            blockchain is based on distributed and decentralized technology.
            However, this does not mean you should simply ignore the platform's
            security standards. Instead, look into the platform's security
            protocols and features. You should also look at how the blockchain
            platform verifies the user's identity and ensures complete data
            privacy and security.
          </p>

          <h4>Community support</h4>
          <p>
            The number of people who use a platform determines its
            dependability. The adoption rate of blockchain platforms is
            increasing as blockchain development technology is used across
            various industries.
          </p>

          <h4>The Number of nodes</h4>
          <p>
            Nodes are the basis of blockchain technology. In a blockchain
            system, it constitutes the entire network. When all nodes in a
            blockchain system or platform verify all conditions, each node is
            responsible for verifying data and allowing transactions or data
            exchange.
          </p>

          <h2>The Top Blockchain Platforms</h2>

            The Hedera Hashgraph platform is a lightning-secure, fast, and fair
            platform that does not require a complex proof-of-work algorithm to
            be computed. Hedera empowers and enables developers to create an
            entirely new class of scalable, decentralized applications.

          <p>
            Smart contracts on the Hedera Hashgraph platform can be made
            dynamic, just like any other software component.Because it includes
            an optional mechanism for "binding arbitration," smart contracts
            deployed with a list of arbitrators public keys can be edited to fix
            bugs or add new features
          </p>
