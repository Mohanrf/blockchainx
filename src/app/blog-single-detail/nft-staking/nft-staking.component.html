            Here's what you need to know about NFT Stacking and how to earn
            money from it
          </h2>

          <p>
            We all understand this rampant blockchain well, don't we? What is
            blockchain and why? What are its main components? What are NFTs in
            Blockchain? Their usage is like etc. Still, here is a summary for
            those who don't know about all this stuff.
          </p>

          <p>
            NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique cryptographic tokens that
            exist on a blockchain network and cannot be replicated. NFTs can
            represent real-world items such as artwork and real estate or a
            video. "Tokenizing" these real-world tangible assets makes buying,
            selling, and trading more efficient while reducing the likelihood of
            fraud.

            We hope that by now you have some basic understanding of NFTs. Here
            we detail what is NFT staking and how to earn money from NFts.
            Without further ado let's get to our topic.
          </p>

          <p>
            These tokenized NFTs can be staked and managed securely on

              NFTs staking platforms
            </a>
            like Binance NFT power station, MOBOX, etc.The word staking hits our
            mind with rewards and returns. It's right in the case of NFT
            staking. Staking your Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) is a viable option
            for building cryptocurrency in modern times. NFT holders have more
            opportunities for gains by investing in NFT staking platforms. This
            raises the value of NFTs today.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many of us think of earning money without losing energy, there are
            many ways. Passive income through the bank is one of the wealthy
            options. If you receive hardly any interest on your money in the
            bank, even you have to pay for your savings. As investing in
            cryptocurrencies and NFTs has relatively high rewards, a new-age
            alternative has been discovered.
          </p>

          <h4>What is NFT Staking?</h4>

          <p>
            The advantage is not only in buying NFTs but also in making money by
            staking them instead. NFTs work on blockchain by staking your unique
            tokens. In short, NFT staking means attaching your non-fungible
            tokens to a platform or protocol. In exchange for this activity, you
            will receive staking rewards. This way, you can earn extra while you
            continue to be the owner of the NFT.
          </p>

          <p>
            We can compare DeFi yield farming with NFT staking, both of which
            are almost the same methods. DeFi yield farming deploys liquidity to
            providers in exchange for benefits in the form of cryptocurrency
            loans or interest or reimbursement of transaction fees. It is like
            the passive income you can earn from a bank but without the bank.
            Compared to the centralized banking system, NFT stacking is more
            prevalent in the decentralized sector of finance.
          </p>

          <h4>How does NFT staking work?</h4>

          <p>
            NFT staking works similarly to staking cryptocurrencies as NFTs are
            tokenized assets. Also, for NFTs, not all non-fungible tokens can be
            staked, just as all tokens can. Since NFTas are tokenized assets,
            you can deploy them on NFT staking platforms where you can keep them
            safe. This is possible through a smart contract on the appropriate
            blockchain protocol.
          </p>

          <p>
            NFTs are creating a new wave in the blockchain world. Staking NFTs
            is a new concept, but it has generated a lot of enthusiasm among NFT
            holders. This is because the unique nature of a non-fungible token
            makes its owners reluctant to part with it. The main difference is
            that buying and selling cryptocurrency is very simple. But stacking
            is somewhat different.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here are three major points that you have ping in your mind while
            staking with NFTs.
          </p>

          <p>1. First, you need a crypto wallet suitable for your NFTs.</p>

          <p>
            2. Check the wallet fits the
            <a [routerLink]="['']"> blockchain </a> on which the NFT is located.
          </p>

          <p>
            3. Connect the wallet to the staking platform and send your NFTs for
            staking.
          </p>

          <p>
            A cryptocurrency wallet compatible with the NFT you want to stake is
            essential. Before attempting to access NFT, you must ensure that
            your chosen wallet is supportive/flexible with the blockchain
            platform. After that, you can transfer your NFTs to the staking
            platform by linking your wallet to the service. You can connect this
            process as "staking" your crypto coins.
          </p>

          <h4>Staking rewards for NFTs</h4>

          <p>
            If you ask what kind of staking rewards an NFT holder gets, the
            answer is it depends on the blockchain platform used for staking and
            the type of NFT. Most NFT staking platforms offer periodic rewards
            i.e, daily and weekly payments. Most often, these rewards are paid
            in the platform's utility token, but there are exceptions.
            Regardless of the tokens used to collect rewards, you can trade
            staking reward tokens and convert them to other cryptocurrencies or
            fiat money.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here we are going to add some salt and pepper to the NFT holders,
            that's DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). These are
            staking platforms where the NFT holder can lock their assets into a
            DAO pool, also known as an NFT staking pool. The highlight of DAOs
            allows NFT holders to participate in governance tasks on the
            platform. This often includes voting rights when proposals are made.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another interesting way to earn staking rewards is through
            blockchain games. Yup, probably most of the NFT on the NFT market
            belong to various blockchain games, there are also various staking
            opportunities in play-to-earn games like The Sandbox, Axie infinity,
            Splinderlands, etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            The main advantage of play-to-earn games is that you can earn not
            only cryptocurrencies but also NFTs. This is a double benefit, which
            means, it makes it possible to earn NFTs for free and then stake
            them.
          </p>

          <h4>How to earn passive income by staking NFTs?</h4>

          <p>
            If you have NFTs in your crypto wallet, you can use them to earn
            passive income. NFT staking is the newest way to generate passive
            income using blockchain technology. As with any such source of
            income, you must invest upfront. In other words, passive income
            through NFTs is primarily earned through cash investments.
          </p>

          <p>
            The popularity of a game can also increase, allowing you to earn
            from the NFT, itself. It is, therefore, important to do proper
            research on the NFT as well as on the market, the utility, and the
            staking rewards.
          </p>

          <h4>What are the top NFTs to stake?</h4>

          <p>
            Think you should stack your NFTs? So make sure what you are aiming
            for. To find the best NFTs for staking, you need to know where the
            opportunities are. So good market research is very important for
            this firm. There are different NFTs that you can invest in, each of
            which has its characteristics. So, make sure your strategy is clear
            to you.

            Are you a gamer? Or interested in investing in this industry? For
            example, an
            <a [routerLink]="['/non-fungible-token-development']">
              NFT staking platform
            </a>
            like Splinterlands is an interesting option for you. Built on the
            Ethereum blockchain, this play-to-earn game allows players to earn
            extra income through NFT staking. Always remember that NFTs can
            downgrades in value, so holding your non-fungible token involves
            risk.
