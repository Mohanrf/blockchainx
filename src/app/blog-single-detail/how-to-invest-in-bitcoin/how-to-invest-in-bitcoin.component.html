          <h1>Why Bitcoin is still a good investment idea in 2021</h1>

          <p>
            Time in a time again, people we work with keep coming back to this
            question, asking us “Is Bitcoin a good investment still?” We’ve been
            tending to this question for years now. However, if one thing has
            become clear to us it is that most people are still oblivious to
            what Bitcoin is. In fact, cryptocurrency in general, and the
            underlying Blockchain Technology, is still in the shadows for a
            majority of people.

          <p>
            While the purpose of this article is not to give you any investment
            advice on cryptocurrencies, we will, however, give you some insight
            into why cryptocurrencies are gaining so much traction, reasons to
            invest in cryptocurrency, and why Bitcoin is a good investment
            option, going into 2021.

          <h2>Digital Currencies, DigiCash, a History</h2>
          <h4>The concept of digital currencies</h4>
          <p>
            Although we have Bitcoin to thank for popularizing the term
            “cryptocurrency,” the concept of digital currencies were
            conceptualized as long back as the 1980s. The first known attempts
            at digital currencies happened in the Netherlands. Fuel stations in
            some of the remoter areas started witnessing a series of robberies
            in the middle of the night. This created a growing concern for the
            safety of the night-shift guards working in these fuel stations. The
            operators were uncomfortable putting the guards at risk.
          </p>

          <p>
            Following these ill events, the operators started giving the truck
            drivers smart cards (which were being trialed at the time). These
            smart cards contained an amount of money as credit and the fuel
            stations started accepting this new digital payment method.
          </p>

          <p>
            The fuel stations were now safe for the truck drivers and security
            guards at night, and voila! Electronic cash was born.
          </p>

          <h4>DigiCash, the Granddaddy of Bitcoin</h4>
          <p>
            The closest relative of Bitcoin took birth with the experiments and
            investigations of American cryptographer and computer scientist
            David Chaum. His company, DigiCash, is one of the earliest digital
            currency companies. He used this firm to introduce ecash in 1989,
            the first proper mainstream predecessor of the modern Bitcoin.
          </p>

          <h4>Drawbacks of Early Digital Currencies</h4>
          <p>
            The major drawback of early digital currencies is related to some
            simple economic principles, more specifically, the concept of supply
            and demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s say that you launch a few thousand digital coins. You own and
            control these coins and what happens to them is completely up to
            you. People start using some of your coins for payments and trading.
            This will generate liquidity and give value to your coins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, out of the blue, you claim that the total number of coins is
            not a few thousand but a few hundred. What this does is that it cuts
            down on the supply of the coins dramatically and the value of the
            coins skyrockets up. While this seems like a good thing for you and
            your coins, this opens doors for major manipulation of the market.
            This compromises trust with your users and, in turn, develops into a
            major threat to the economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is one of the major reasons that many economists explicitly
            objected to the idea of digital currencies initially.
          </p>

          <h2>Satoshi Nakamoto, Blockchain, Bitcoin</h2>

          <p>
            In 2008, USA witnessed one of the most challenging economic crisis
            of recent times. And, of course, this affected the world economy
            drastically. However, it was also a major checkpoint in the timeline
            of the global economy, shedding the light on the rusty attitudes of
            the evangelists of global finance, who seemed to be a little bit
            callous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right around this time, an anonymous person or a group of people
            named Satoshi Nakamoto published a white paper. The white paper was
            a document outlining the concept, the technology, and the ways to
            implement a new kind of system. A public distributed ledger system
            called Blockchain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, they also introduced a new kind of digital currency,
            one that is cryptographically secured, and functions on this
            Blockchain ledger. As a result, Bitcoin was born.
          </p>

          <h2>Advantages of Bitcoin</h2>
          <p>
            The major advantage of Bitcoin over traditional digital currencies
            is that Bitcoin runs completely on the Blockchain. Blockchain
            Technology is the backbone of all cryptocurrencies we see today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blockchain provides superior performance over other ledger systems
            owing to 4 major advantages.
          </p>

          <p class="pb-2">1. Security.</p>
          <p class="pb-2">2. Transparency.</p>
          <p class="pb-2">3. Immutability.</p>
          <p>4. Decentralization.</p>

          <p>
            Blockchain is a distributed ledger system with no central authority.
            You can think of the ledger as a database that spreads across
            several servers all over the world. We call these databases Blocks
            and they are interconnected. When new data comes in, the system
            creates a new block and stores it there. Each new block will have
            something called the cryptographic Hash of the previous block, which
            is basically like an encrypted text file with a password and some
            data input from the previous block.
          </p>

          <p>
            If any hacker or even the person wants to change something inside an
            existing block, they would have to decipher this Hash. This single
            process alone involves solving highly complicated mathematical
            computations and requires a lot of computing power. Moreover, if
            someone tries to make any change to a block, all other blocks will
            be notified.
          </p>

          <p>
            To clarify, if someone wanted to practically hack into the system,
            they would have to do so with each and every block in the
            Blockchain. And since the system distributes each block across
            different servers, there is no central point of weakness. A hacker
            would need an extreme amount of computing power to carry out this
            task, which is practically impossible.
          </p>

          <p>
            We’ve been talking more about hackers but like we said, even the
            person who created the Blockchain can’t make any changes to it.
            Moreover, on a Public Blockchain, all transactions are publicly
            visible to all participants. As a result, Blockchain Technology
            emerges as the most trustworthy and transparent system there is.

          <h2>
            Let’s get to the question of the hour “Should I invest in Bitcoin?”
          </h2>
          <p>
            The answer to this question somewhat applies to most if not all
            cryptocurrencies. But for the purpose of this article, we’ll talk
            about Bitcoin.
          </p>
          <p>
            A total of 21 Million Bitcoins (BTC) were launched at the start of
            the project. In other words, there will only be 21 Million Bitcoins
            in existence. Nearly 18.6 Million Bitcoins have been mined until
            now, we guess you get the point now. Here comes the principle of
            Supply and Demand. When the Supply is limited and the Demand is
            more, the value of the currency also increases significantly.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s no surprise that the price of Bitcoin is at an all-time high
            right now. Moreover, with people trading the currency more and more
            every day, this high liquidity-generating cryptocurrency will keep
            gaining value for the years to come. Additionally, when all the 21
            Million Bitcoins come into circulation, the price will likely
            skyrocket quite dramatically.
          </p>

          <h2>So, is Bitcoin a good investment in 2021?</h2>
          <p>
            Bitcoin is a great investment and will be a great investment in 2021
            and the years to come, given that the project carries on its current
            course. Keep in mind that the value of cryptocurrencies is highly
            volatile. You could make millions in a day and lose it all the next
            hour. It depends solely on the market at that time. However, in the
            long term, you could definitely profit off of this revolutionary
            currency if you keep a close eye on the market and act at the right
            time.
