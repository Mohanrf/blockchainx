          <h1>Know everything about Substrate</h1>

          <p>
            The substrate is a framework for the quick creation of complete
            blockchains and
            <a class="content-link" [routerLink]="['/dapps-development']"
              >decentralized applications (dApps)</a
            >. It is an open-source technology used to build blockchains and
            customize them with maximum technical freedom and flexibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Substrate promotes the direct creation of and migration to Polkadot
            parachains. It is gaining much popularity because of its leisure and
            good results. It is reliable, stable, and fast at the same time. We
            will get to see in the future how it will eventually handle
            blockchain development projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this blog, we are going to explore the Substrate blockchain
            framework, how to develop a custom blockchain with a substrate, and
            what its relation with Polkadot is. So, letâ€™s get down to business.
          </p>

          <h2>what is Substrate?</h2>
          <p>
            The substrate is a
            <a class="content-link" [routerLink]="['']"
              >blockchain development framework</a
            >
            developed by Parity technologies that enables software developers to
            build decentralized systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Substrate features include safe and scalable blockchain logic, a
            rich user experience for any chain, compatibility with the polkadot
            ecosystem, and support for other smart contract platforms such as
            the
            <a class="content-link" [routerLink]="['/erc20-token-development']"
              >Ethereum Virtual Machine</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Substrate exhibits an efficient database that developers can
            leverage to run and maintain
            <a class="content-link" [routerLink]="['']"
              >blockchain-based applications</a
            >. All substrate-based chains are compatible with Polkadot and
            Kusama, providing para-chain permit to a rich, interoperable
            ecosystem of applications and resources.
          </p>

          <h2>Substrate-based blockchain</h2>
          <p class="pb-2">
            <i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> Substrate enables the creation of
            specialized blockchains for any use case and was used by Parity
            technologies itself to develop Polkadot, which declares its high
            level of performance, flexibility, and robustness.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2">
            <i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> While Substrate can be used to create
            any type of blockchain, not just Polkadot Parachains, connecting to
            Polkadot brings several benefits, including built-in security,
            cross-chain interoperability, and support for Polkadot's platform,
            application, and access to a developing ecosystem of the user.
          </p>

          <h2>Substrate and Polkadot</h2>
          <p>
            Substrate-based chains are compatible with becoming para-chains to
            integrate into Polkadot or Kusama. Essentially, Substrate is the
            software development kit with which parachains can be built and a
            means of securing Polkadot chains and allowing them to communicate
            with each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, although they are synergistic, Polkadot and Substrate do
            not depend on each other. Polkadot para chains can be created and
            protected without tickling Substrate (although alternative software
            options for doing so are currently limited) and chains designed with
            Substrate need not be connected to Polkadot or Kusama.
            Substrate-based chains can exist as 'single chains' on an
            independent basis.

          <h2>Substrate blockchain framework</h2>
          <p>
            Projects built using Substrate can be easily set up on the Polkadot
            ecosystem, allowing them to take advantage of the growing network to
            drive wider application adoption.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyone can build a new blockchain with the Substrate Framework.
            However, their DApps will still be similar to Polkadot as they are
            built on the same framework. Broadly speaking, Substrate has mostly
            been used to build projects that advance the Polkadot ecosystem.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Why is substrate the best technology to build with now and in the
            future?
          </h2>
          <h4>Explore Tools</h4>
          <p>
            While some tools have been documented more extensively such as a
            subquery, memory profiling, and try runtime, many additional tools
            exist that have yet to be integrated into Substrate's documentation
            hub.
          </p>
          <h4>Light client based</h4>
          <p>
            The light client allows you to interact with the blockchain in a
            less resource-intensive way. Because they can promptly connect to a
            blockchain and run in browsers and mobiles and across multiple
            devices, convenient clients are stable enough to power the future of
            decentralized applications.
          </p>
          <h4>Forkless upgrades</h4>
          <p>
            Polkadot's option to go forkless also addresses the issue of forks
            with multiple upgrades, which has caused frustration within the
            community as some upgrade suggestions have been delayed or even
            ignored. This allows network maintainers to leverage the
            capabilities of the blockchain for reliable, decentralized consensus
            to securely increase runtime.
          </p>
          <h4>As a matter of fact,</h4>
          <p>
            Any blockchain created on Substrate can be easily migrated to the
            Polkadot Parachain. So the speed and convenience of substrate
            evolution can be increased by the network effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope you can see why we say that Substrate is a protractible,
            modular, and open-source platform for developing
            <a class="content-link" [routerLink]="['']">blockchain systems</a>.
            At every point in the substrate growth process, maintaining that
            things are simple has been a priority. Subsequently, Substrate can
            be used as a platform to build future technologies. Substrate is a
            tool that can certainly change the
            <a class="content-link" [routerLink]="['']"
              >blockchain development</a
            >
            process.
