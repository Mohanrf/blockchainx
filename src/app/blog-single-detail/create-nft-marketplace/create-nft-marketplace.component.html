          <h4>What is an NFT Marketplace ?</h4>

          <p>
            A NFT marketplace is a platform that sells non-fungible tokens from
            various owners and creators. For example, OpenSea, the world's first
            and largest NFT platform, displays pictures as well as collections.
            Users have the option of creating and launching their own NFT
            collection or a single NFT. They can also sell and buy digital
            assets for collectibles or resale. The owner of the marketplace
            receives commission fees from the launch and sale of a collection.
          </p>

          <h4>Technology invented in 2023: features of the NFT marketplace</h4>

          <h4>Storefront</h4>

          <p>
            The storefront is a landing page where the actual trading and
            bidding take place. In general, it should be appealing in order to
            capture the attention of visitors, which can eventually lead to more
            leads.
          </p>

          <h4>Listings</h4>

          <p>
            Sellers can list their NFTs on the marketplace after minting them.
            Thus, users can refer to the collections and select the ones they
            want.
          </p>

          <h4>Search Explorer</h4>

          <p>
            This tool assists buyers in navigating NFTs. It is now simple to
            browse the various collections by directing the cursor to a single
            location, which is the search bar.
          </p>

          <h4>Filter aid</h4>

          <p>
            The filter option will list the different types of NFTs available in
            the marketplace. Domain names, prices, and owners, among other
            things, are used to sort the collections.
          </p>

          <h4>Bids</h4>

          <p>
            Users have the option of placing bids or auctions. The most common
            kinds are English and Dutch auctions. They have the ability to
            persuade users to buy NFTs at the desired price.
          </p>

          <h4>Wallet</h4>

          <p>
            A digital wallet can be used to store or trade NFTs in the
            marketplace. To carry out a safe and secure transaction, the user
            requires a wallet to initiate the trade. The wallet can be built
            into the marketplace or bought from an external vendor.
          </p>

          <h4>Reviews and ratings</h4>

          <p>
            This is crucial feedback from previous traders. To proceed, newbies
            can read these comments.
          </p>

          <h4>NFT Rankings</h4>

          <p>
            When an NFT is purchased, the ranking is displayed. This can
            represent the potential of NFTs to users and thus increase the
            market for that specific vertical.
          </p>

          <h4>Favorites in NFTs</h4>

          <p>
            Users can add their NFTs to their favorites, similar to a
            marketplace wishlist.
          </p>

          <h4>Smart contracts</h4>

          <p>
            It is a digital contract that follows their own set of rules and
            guidelines. Thus, both sellers and buyers must adhere to these
            so-called guidelines. After mutual agreement, the operation can be
            carried out in the marketplace.
          </p>
