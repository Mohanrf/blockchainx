            How Influencial Is Blockchain In Identity Managements In The Digital
            Era?
          </h1>
          <p>
            Each of us has our identity, not just us, from something I'm typing
            out here to that even doesn’t exist has their kinda identifications
            for their existence in this so-called space. And we have to relate
            this with digital transformation, a Digital identity especially for
            a human is the keynote to denote one’s unique existence here. From a
            long gazette, we have now come to cut down paper works and use cloud
            storage, which is comparatively less but with a substantial amount
            of data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, the traction over digital identities is buzzing that has
            now a status with global recognition. Identities as it calls
            themselves to be, denote one's existence in the real world, and that
            also explains their different attributes elaborating on their
            physical form. Through digital transformations happening worldwide,
            from data stored in the cloud and drives that ease data handling.
            And now, in no surprise Digital identity is rendered through
            blockchain, spruce casting one’s identity that is unique and
            accurate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us explore if this transformation towards digital identities
            rendered through
            <a [routerLink]="['']"> blockchain networks </a> is effective. And
            in terms of long-term goals of accomplishing global desires, are
            these transitions help in the best way to support better data
            handling?
          </p>

          <h2>Identity - The Transformation That The World Is Looking Up To</h2>
          <p>
            One's identity is usually referred to by their name, height, weight,
            color, etc., where all of which constitute or define one's physical
            appearance. Driving licenses, school/college/office ID cards,
            electricity bills, voter ID, and many unique identity cards denoting
            the same purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later, the hit over digitization ignited the transformation of
            massive paperwork to a digitally enlightened infrastructure reducing
            wallet spaces, and this time it is comparatively more to store with
            less storage accumulation. There are digitized identity structures.
          </p>

          <h2>Classification of user data</h2>
          <p class="pb-2">
            <i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> Companies and organizations
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2">

          </p>
          <p class="pb-2"><i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> Individuals data</p>
          <p>
            This has helped a major part of the ecosystem. Let it be companies
            who collected sensitive information from users and stored them on a
            routine basis, eventually risking the creative business with the use
            of user privacy-centric regulations and the industries focused on
            corporate IT responsibilities. While these wouldn't contribute to
            understanding customers or driving product improvements. And this
            can be well achieved with stronger IT compatibilities in the right
            balance and prepositions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next comes IoT Devices. For about seven billion
            internet-connected devices, the numbers are constantly expected to
            grow and in the next three years, the scale shall increase to triple
            the time of this estimation. As most of the IoT technologies do not
            comprehend actual identity and access management capabilities,
            trusting them still hangs doubtful. These systems as they majorly
            drive to identify sensors, monitors, and devices and also manage
            access to sensitive and non-sensitive data in a secured system. Most
            leading IT hubs are comfortable in rendering IoT management systems
            and addressing these service gaps.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final set of audiences are individuals whose identities are
            integral to the function of a society and economy. Having our
            identification is important and mandatory. In the process, we will
            also have to accept that not everyone carries a physical form of
            identification for different reasons. And at the same time, we also
            have to note that approximately 1.1 billion people do not own their
            identity for themselves - leaving 1/7th of the population
            vulnerable. This inability also constitutes jeopardizing one’s
            financial system, limiting freedom. Eventually, this also has its
            impact on people or individuals who have their official
            identification and also have situations that are not so encouraging.
            As data hacking and duplication are so common.
          </p>
          <p>
            From there the upgrade in the tech industry seems like a very long
            step taken forward with the concept of Digital Identity. The
            intrusion of decentralization and its shift has brought in a
            complete revolution upside completely round. Unlike having different
            cards, one identity for every single query on you. DID (Digital ID)
            is uniquely rendered to perform systematically and maintain accuracy
            and security.
          </p>

          <h2>
            What Is Digital Identity (DID) And Its Emergence In Importance?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Digital identity itself has its significance, before considering its
            impact with the influence of blockchain. In general, its notion is
            assumed to hold an individual's personal information of a person
            that is available on the internet. But it is not exactly that, the
            digital identity of a person does include their social media
            profiles or emails, and others. Instead, it encompasses all that one
            holds on the web. Including images, preferences in shopping, user
            behavior, account information, payment choices, etc.
          </p>

          <h2>Denoting digital identity in the blockchain</h2>
          <p>
            However, the representation of Digital identity varies from platform
            to platform in the digital spaces - Banking systems, social media
            platforms, telecom networks, etc. While DID establishes the identity
            of an Individual both online and offline.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we have to address the impact of
            <a [routerLink]="['']"> Blockchain on Digital Identity,</a>
            it shall be exclusive and dependent on the foundation of its
            importance. As accuracy is a major key to increasing the speed of
            process for customer onboarding, DID is crucial to prevent
            fraudulent activities like money laundering, etc. Here Digital
            identity management systems help manage the streamlining and
            standardization of citizenship services offered by nations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of social transformation projects, Digital identities play
            a vital role, while it ensures economic improvements for communities
            through different measures. To consider, we shall take Singapore.
            Their National Digital Identity system is one of the smartest
            initiatives helping citizens to access government services online.
          </p>

          <h2>Beneficiaries Of Digital Identity Managements In Blockchain</h2>
          <p>
            The EU General Data Protection Regulation provides modern solutions
            and strengthens its standards alongside. Through distributed ledgers
            infused in the scenario, Governments try to establish a well-own
            bestowed identity to the unidentified to protect citizens' personal
            information.

            DID enjoys the following benefits through blockchain technologies.

          <h4>Public Key Infrastructures - Decentralized identity</h4>
          <p>
            By enabling PKI Identity holders are offered tamper proof, trusted
            medium to distribute asymmetric verifications and encrypted keys.
            This enables everyone to curate cryptographic keys on the
            tamper-proof blockchain networks in chronological order. It allows
            users to verify digital signatures, encrypted data, etc. in the
            process, we will also have to consider Certificate Authorities to
            provide traditional certification before decentralized solutions.
            While blockchain technology has made it much easier and simpler in
            many use cases than centralized solutions. Many of us are adopting
            verifiable credentials that are digitized credentials coming with
            cryptographic proofs.
          </p>

          <h4>Completely decentralized storage</h4>
          <p>
            The identities on the blockchain are inherited and stored on
            centralized servers. Through cryptographical
            <a [routerLink]="['/erc20-token-development']"
              >Ethereum blockchain</a
            >
            combinations, interplanetary File-systems that are distributed data
            storage systems or OrbitDB can do this intermediate centralization
            of data storage systems that maintain trust and data integrity. The
            tamper-proof decentralized storage solutions are structures to
            reduce entity and ability to accumulate data access and deny
            unauthorized sources that exploit and monetize through individual's
            confidential information. Moreover, this is one of the core
            components to secure identity data management. The decentralized
            framework credentials are directly stored in the user’s device which
            is termed as uPort’s trust graph or 3Box. And to add on with user
            control the identities are self-sovereign, and the worry about it
            getting revoked is eliminated. And the data under the user's control
            is interoperable at the same.
          </p>

          <h4>Easy Manageability And control</h4>
          <p>
            The entity provided for the identity is generally responsible for
            its security. Through decentralized identity frameworks, security
            becomes the main priority of the user to decide to implement their
            security measures on their measures and outsource tasks to services
            including digital bank vault, a password manager like applications,
            etc. Moreover, decentralized identity solutions force hackers to
            attack individual data stores that are costly and unprofitable.
          </p>

          <h4>Various Use cases of Blockchain Identity Management</h4>
          <p>
            Let us discuss various use cases of blockchain-based Digital
            identity management.
          </p>
          <p>Use Cases Of Digital Identity Management In Blockchain</p>
          <p class="pb-2">
            <i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> Identities are empowered with the
            ability to self-sustain.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2">
            <i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> The user data has capabilities to

          <p class="pb-2">
            <i class="bi bi-check-lg"></i> Data probabilities make them easily
            accessible.
          </p>

          <h4>Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) - Self Sustainable</h4>
          <p>
            The concept of Self sovereign identity is where people and
            businesses store their identity on their devices, and a chosen piece
            of information is shared to validate without depending on any
            centralized repository of data identity. This allows the data
            creation of independent nation-states, corporations, or any other
            global organization.
          </p>

          <h4>Data Monetization</h4>
          <p>
            With the ability to examine who owns the data and the profit shared,
            blockchain-based SSI gives control to users through decentralized
            modules and carves a path to data monetization. In general data,
            monetization refers to making quantifiable economic benefits where
            the information gathered from personally identified data
            substantially has increased value. By the end of 2022, it is
            expected that nearly 60% of the global GDP from 4.39 billion
            internet users are to be digitized. That assures an increase in the
            personal data count.
          </p>

          <h4>User Data Portability</h4>
          <p>
            The users are granted the right to data portability from Article 20
            of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. This
            pertains to data subject rights where data can be transmitted
            directly from one to another controller - which is also technically
            feasible. This enhances user experience and cuts down the need to
            re-verify identity across different services and platforms. It is
            also possible to migrate identities anchored on a targeted system to
            one another with ease. Moreover, data portability reduces friction
            for users and simplifies sign-up processes. And through reusable DID
            with quick KYC it's easy to regulate and also control user
            onboarding avoiding dropout rates.
          </p>

          <h2>Blockchain-Based DID Contributing To Economic Growth</h2>
          <p>
            With its futuristic approach to
            <strong> Blockchain,</strong> Digital ID is expected to contribute
            hugely to economic growth. And in a decade, it is considered
            inclusive as it has benefited individuals largely with the ability
            to stimulate economic activity for the global market.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is seen that Decentralized Identity modules give the users a
            chance to unlock values contributing to greater economic growth in
            the global market. With decentralization picking itself into various
            streams, it has been a refined addition to progress, and data
            security in the first place is well coordinated with ease!
