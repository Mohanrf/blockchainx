          <h1>What is a DAO, and How does it relate to DAO in NFTs?</h1>

          <p>
            Spend any amount of time in the cryptoverse, and you will hear a lot
            about DAOs. From DAOs aiming to buy the US Constitution to NFT
            projects looking to encourage investment through DAO-led incentives,
            the influence and power of this nascent technology are only now
            being realized.
          </p>
          <p>
            A DAO is an acronym for "Decentralized Autonomous Organization."
            They are available as smart contracts on
            <a [routerLink]="['/types-of-blockchain']"> various blockchains </a>
            and allow individuals to collaborate and pool capital. DAOs are used
            to manage and secure blockchains autonomously, acquire assets such
            as NFTs, and borrow and lend cryptocurrencies. While familiarity
            with DAOs and their operation takes time and interaction, you can
            get a head start by learning how they work and how the crypto space
            is currently utilizing them. In this article, we will look at what a
            DAO is, why they exist, and where they are supposed to go ?
          </p>

          <h2>What is the DAO?</h2>
          <div class="blog-picture">
            <img
              src="assets-new/images/blog-single/dao/What is the DAO.jpg"
              class="img-fluid"
              alt="what is dao?"
              width="100%"
              height="100%"

          <p>
            A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization. It is a type of
            governance system that is enabled by smart contracts and blockchain
            technology. Blockchains are based on decentralization, which means
            they are not controlled by a single central authority, like a
            government. As a result, a DAO establishes an organization run by a
            group of people with no typical company hierarchy. The group makes
            its own rules and makes decisions based on smart contracts on a
            blockchain. The blockchain is used to record all rules and
            transactions, obviating the need for a central entity.
          </p>
          <p>
            DAO, in fact, operates as a company without an executive board. It
            is similar to a company that works autonomously and without
            leadership. Here, a group of people with similar interests come
            together to work toward a common goal, and as a result, a bottom-up
            approach is used to manage the company and make operational
            decisions through voting. Voting in the DAO is based on asset
            ownership, or tokens. You can see how tokens impact the digital
            world now: members vote based on the tokens they own. The DAO is a
            decentralized community with no hierarchy that makes decisions with
            tokens.
          </p>

          <h2>How Does a DAO Function?</h2>
          <div class="blog-picture">
            <img
              src="assets-new/images/blog-single/dao/How Does a DAO Function.jpg"
              class="img-fluid"
              alt="DAO Function"
              width="100%"
              height="100%"

            />
          </div>
          <p>
            The DAO is based on smart contracts, which execute automatically if
            certain conditions are met. These smart contracts represent the
            organization's rules, which are determined through voting. A DAO can
            also send and receive funds without the use of a human intermediary.
          </p>
          <p>
            The voting system is based on purchasing
            <a [routerLink]="['/dao-development-company']"> DAO tokens,</a>
            which are typically purchased with Ethereum; members can vote on
            rules and directly influence company changes through smart
            contracts. This horizontal, transparent organizational structure
            comes from the critical role of voting through the participation of
            members, mainly in each DAO's Discord.
          </p>
          <h2>How are DAOs and NFTs related?</h2>
          <p>
            To put it simply, a DAO is a way to control the communities related
            to an NFT, and an NFT is a digital asset. It is already known that
            both NFT and DAO place a strong emphasis on ownership; whereas NFT
            gives creators ownership, DAO offers governance. A work of art,
            music, or other content is uploaded to the blockchain by NFT
            creators. The blockchain assures the unique ownership of buyers in
            addition to the security and authenticity of the digital assets.
          </p>
          <p>
            NFTs decentralized community governance is assisted by the DAO. For
            a powerful decentralized media that offers investments on the
            Internet, DAO in NFT could be combined. The NFT creator is the
            owner, and the DAO token holder is the operator.
          </p>
          <p>
            NFT creators collaborate using the DAO. Generally speaking, they
            were divided into one of two categories: individual or collective.
            Popular artists like Grimes cast, mine, and sell their NFT
            individually. While they already have followers, the newly promoted
            artists, on the other hand, require a collective unit. This
            collective unit is managed by the DAO in order to crowdfund, invest,
            support, market, and ultimately pay the holders of the collective
            tokens.
          </p>
          <p>
            The DAO is crucial to a collection because as an NFT is created by
            the artist, it is sold to the DAO, which mines its token and
            converts it into an NFT. The NFT then accepts the issued tokens as
            collateral. Tokens are valuable if NFT is. As a result, through a
            liquidity event, the DAO can sell NFT to stakeholders. The systems
            ensure that over time, tokens gain value.
          </p>

          <h2>Prominent NFT DAOs</h2>

          <h4>APE DAO</h4>

          </div>
          <p>
            APE DAO was founded by Kylo.eth, a collector of bored apes. To
            launch the NFT DAO in June 2021, 49 BAYC NFTs and a female
            CryptoPunk were fractionalized into 1,000,000 APED tokens, allowing
            anyone to own parts of these highly sought-after NFTs. The tokens
            sold out in just four days, demonstrating the DAO's success. Later,
            members of this DAO donated even more NFTs, such as CyberKongz,
            Avastar, Punk's Comic, and so on. Furthermore, the DAO is governed
            by the community through $APED shards.

            Pleasr DAO was founded as an NFT DAO to collect funds for the
            purchase of high-value NFTs. Members of the Pleasr DAO share the
            total costs and ownership of digital assets. Pleasr DAO was
            previously formed to collectively purchase
            <a [routerLink]="['/uniswap-clone-script']"> Uniswap </a>
            V3 NFT artwork, titled "x-y-k," designed by @pplpleasr1, to
            commemorate the upcoming update of the most popular DEX-Uniswap. To
            further its mission, the Pleasr DAO is still used to buy and
            commission NFT artwork, invest in decentralized finance, and run an
            incubator. Pleasr DAO's current goals include expanding collections,
            incubating new cryptocurrency products and artists, and investing
            angels in the cryptocurrency market.

          <p>
            Jenny Metaverse DAO has been set up on the Unicly platform. It
            purchases NFTs and keeps them in a vault. As a result, the NFTs are
            represented by the native uJENNY token. uJENNY token holders gain
            governance rights and can vote on decisions such as releasing NFTs
            from the vault, acquiring NFTs, and any other necessary changes.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Should Businesses Be Concerned About NFTs and DAOs?</h2>
          <p>
            Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized autonomous
            organizations (DAOs) will ruin the entire business world. The
            ultimate strength of NFTs and DAOs lies in the smart contracts that
            are built into them. Businesses can eliminate a lot of red tape by
            utilizing smart contracts. Smart contracts are based on triggers and
            actions, such as "if this, then that." In other words, if this
            trigger occurs, this action occurs.
          </p>
          <p>
            These
            <a [routerLink]="['/smart-contract-development']">
              smart contracts,</a
            >
            however, can benefit more than just large corporations. Smaller
            businesses could also save time and money by removing middlemen, red
            tape, escrow fees, and agents. If the work is completed, the funds
            are transferred into their wallet without the need for someone to
            review and approve an invoice or for banks to process their fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can code your NFT's smart contract to automatically send a
            percentage of the proceeds to your DAO whenever the NFTs are sold.
            Depending on the other smart contracts in place, these funds can
            help it achieve its mission, one of the goals on its roadmap, or
            launch a new project.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, not every business will need to consider NFTs or DAOs. They
            might not be applicable to your business model at all. Before you
            dive in, consider what a DAO would do for your industry, as well as
            your vision or mission for what that DAO would accomplish.
          </p>

          <h2>Sum up</h2>
          <p>
            DAOs have been around for a while and have a wide range of
            interesting applications. They can be a useful tool in assisting the
            growth of existing and emerging NFT projects in the NFT space. As
            the NFT space expands, we can expect to see more projects
            incorporating DAOs.
