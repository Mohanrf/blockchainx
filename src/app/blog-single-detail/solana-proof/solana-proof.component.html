          <h1>Solana: The world's first blockchain to use proof of history</h1>

          <p>
            When comparing the prominent Ethereum blockchain, Salona is very
            fast and is the most high-throughput blockchain in the market. Let
            your next project start with Solana, a fast and innovative
            blockchain.
          </p>

          <p>
            Blockchain technology aims to make transactions instantaneous, no
            matter where you sit. So, how fast are blockchain networks? Have you
            ever wondered?
          </p>

          <p>
            The fastest transaction record for Ethereum 2.0 blockchain is 10,000
            transactions per second (TPS). But if you ask if there is any other
            high-speed network in the market today to compete with this. That's
            Solana. The Solana blockchain has an attribute of cryptographic
            time-sampling that can manage network traffic and scale up to 65,000
            TPS. So Solana is the fastest public blockchain for single
            transactions at the moment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, you understand transaction speed ​​(TS) is one of the
            significant factors in blockchain development as it also drives
            network traffic. So, what is the benefit of this fast transaction
            process? Blockchain's high transaction speed results in better data
            exchange between various parties up to firm transactions.
          </p>

            Go through this blog and let's deep dive from one end to the other
            end of Solana Blockchain. Everything you need to know about Solana
            Blockchain.
          </p>

          <h4>What is the Solana Blockchain?</h4>

          <p>
            Solana is a public blockchain service built to be decentralized and
            very quick in terms of transaction speeds. the consensus mechanism
            behind this fast network is proof of history and proof of stake.
          </p>

            <a [routerLink]="['/everything-you-need-to-know-about-web3']">
              Web3
            </a>
            terminology, Solana is considered a Layer 1 chain, which means it
            provides the fundamental base structure to build smart contracts.
            <a [routerLink]="['/comparison-of-solana-polygon-ethereum']">
              Solana and Ethereum blockchain
            </a>
            are similar in that both offer their token and a distributed machine
            to execute smart contracts and connects decentralized apps (dApps).
          </p>

          <p>
            Solana can manage peer-to-peer transactions using its native token
            called
            <a [routerLink]="['/hire-solana-developers']"> SOL </a>
            and can reach up to 50,000 TPS. Solana is one of the most used
            blockchains for developing on-chain applications, and it supports
            smart contracts and non-fungible tokens.
          </p>

          <h4>Do you know who the founder of Solana is?</h4>

          <p>
            Solana was founded in 2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko. Anatoly Yakovenko
            is a Russian computer engineer who authored the Solana White Paper.
          </p>

          <p>
            2021 was a successful year for Solana, with the project garnering a
            lot of attention despite Ethereum's glacial transition to Ethereum
            2.0. Solana's SOL token went from an average of $2 in 2020 to over
            $200 in 2021.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yakovenko says of Solana that the NFT use case is "obvious going
            forward. Every technology you build for finance means the network
            needs to be as cheap, fast, and reliable as possible, while Solana
            is built as "a blockchain at Nasdaq speed."
          </p>

          <h4>Supporting Pillars of Solana</h4>

          <div class="blog-picture pt-2">

          </div>

          <h4>Token Economics and Distribution of Solana</h4>

          <p>
            SOL is Solana's native token. You can use SOL to pay transaction
            fees and interact with various
            <a [routerLink]="['/dapps-development']"> dApps.</a>
            Getting SOL is also easy, you can earn SOL by contributing to the
            network as a node or validator. Tokanomics behind SOL revolves
            around scalability and security. Within the network we can use the
            SOL for two purposes, they are
          </p>
          <h4>Staking</h4>

          <p>
            The Solana network uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Each
            validator in the network has the opportunity to participate in
            consensus on which blocks they believe should be added to the
            blockchain, thereby confirming any valid transactions contained in
            those particular blocks. However, not all validator's votes count
            equally.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can stake your SOL directly into the network or delegate your
            holding to an active validator. Stakeholders get inflationary
            benefits in exchange. Solana recently made its inflation
            compensation possible this year.
          </p>

          <h4>Used as transaction and smart contracts fee</h4>

          <p>
            If you are a Solana user, you can use SOL to send transaction fees
            and execute/run smart contracts. SOL can help you to interact with
            dApps.
          </p>

          <p>
            Solana distributed the token SOL in five financing rounds, four of
            which were private sales. This private sale began in the first
            quarter of 2019 and culminated in MultiCoin Capital's $20 million
            Series A, which was disclosed in July 2019. Other partners included
            Distributed Global, BlockTower Capital, Foundation Capital,
            BlockChange VC, Slow Ventures, NEO Global Capital, Passport Capital,
            and Rockaway Ventures. In exchange for their investments, companies
            received SOL tokens.
          </p>

          <p>
            The team did not disclose how many tokens private investors acquired
            through the sale. The fourth and final private sale took place in
            2020. The team raised $4 million from a public auction hosted by
            CoinList.
          </p>
          <p>The initial distribution of SOL tokens is as follows:</p>

          </div>

          <h4>Blockchain consensus mechanisms</h4>

          <p>
            The term consensus mechanism refers to the entire collection of
            protocols, incentives, and concepts that allow a network of nodes to
            agree on the state of a blockchain.
          </p>

          <p>
            A blockchain is called a distributed ledger or database. Each
            blockchain has several nodes that have unique identity numbers. Each
            node has two roles to accomplish, they make claims and validate
            them.
          </p>

          <p>
            When making a claim, a node acts in the role of a client
            application. In blockchain terminology, this type of node is called
            a wallet. A wallet takes its private key and makes an assertion or
            claim to the network. The network then passes that claim to a
            validation task. Nodes selected for the validation task are called
            full nodes or validator nodes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Blockchain uses a consensus mechanism to send claims through the
            network. A network's consensus mechanism is the algorithm used to
            arrive at a shared version of the truth.
          </p>

          <h4>The Proof of History: Solana’s Consensus Mechanism</h4>

          <p>
            Proof of History is just one of the innovations that make Solana the
            most performant blockchain in the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            The consensus mechanism is a fundamental characteristic and
            difference between blockchains. But Solana's consensus mechanism is
            worth picking up. Solana follows a different mechanism from the
            existing consensus mechanism. In particular, the Proof of History
            algorithm enables faster processing times and lower transaction
            costs.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is not too difficult to learn what the proof of history mechanism
            is. All of these are detailed in Solana's white paper. However, it
            is a bit difficult to understand how to speed up transaction time
            and reduce transaction costs.
          </p>

          <p>
            The key issue in blockchains is agreeing on the time and order in
            which events occur. Solana uses Proof of History (PoH) to overcome
            this problem by establishing a cryptographically secure time source
            across the network.
          </p>

          <p>
            Proof of history is a high-frequency verifiable delay function (VDF)
            that takes a fixed number of steps to evaluate but returns a unique
            result that can be verified in public.
          </p>

          <h4>Proof of Stake and the verifiable delay function</h4>

          <p>
            Even if there is a proof of history mechanism, Solana additionally
            requires a consensus mechanism, for which the proof of stake
            mechanism is used. But its validators do their proof of work against
            blocks called verifiable delay functions (VDFs).
          </p>

          <p>
            The main idea of ​​VDF is to run a function that takes input and
            produces an output that cannot be predicted without running the
            function. Then you chain these together - the output of the last
            function provides the input to the next function.
          </p>

          <p>
            A cryptographic hash function is used to chaining the VDFs. This
            provides an ongoing stream of cryptographically verifiable moments
            in time.
          </p>

            status is still a step behind. The idea of ​​running a
            multi-billion-asset network as a trial might raise a few eyebrows,
            but that's Web3 for you. Solana sees it as going through a process
            of shaking out bugs to achieve high stability based on the
            proof-of-history concept.
          </p>
