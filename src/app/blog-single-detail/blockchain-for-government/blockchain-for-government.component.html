            Blockchain in Government: A Step Towards a Better Tomorrow Bitcoin
            is still a good investment idea in 2021
          </h1>

          <p>
            The application of blockchain in government and public services can
            solve the problems that have been haunting the system for a long
            time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most people know blockchain as the foundation for cryptocurrencies.
            But the technology has a much greater potential that spans across
            almost any sector that you can think of.
          </p>

          <p>
            Governmental organizations all over the world were quite skeptical
            about the technology. But that was because they didn’t know much
            about this it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, governments from different parts of the globe are looking into
            the infinite possibilities of blockchain technology.
          </p>

          <h2>What makes the system tick?</h2>

          <p>
            A democratic government is a system where people are supposed to
            exercise the authority of the government.
          </p>
          <p>
            The people who are citizens of a state elect their representatives
            through an election process and these representatives run the
            government on behalf of the people.
          </p>
          <p>
            In theory, the “people” are supposedly the ones with the “power.”
            But in reality, the government often fails to ensure even basic
            human rights to the citizens.
          </p>

          <h2>Where the system has slipped</h2>

          <p>
            The fact of the matter is that the government has a bad name when it
            comes to public services. This makes blockchain application in
            government the need of the hour.
          </p>
          <p>
            People complain all the time about how inefficient government
            offices are in processing requests and sanctioning funds to the
            public.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the roots of the problem go deeper than what we see on the
            outside. The centralized system undoubtedly has many disadvantages,
            which we will look at right now.
          </p>

          <h2>Lack of transparency</h2>
          <p>
            Lack of transparency in governmental affairs is something that goes
            against the concept of democracy itself. Yes, you have to keep some
            information confidential, such as that of the military, to ensure
            national security. But the system that is supposedly run by the
            “people” forces its citizens to be unaware of what happens around
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have to wait a whole year before we know what the government has
            done with our tax money. And at times, we even have trouble
            accessing our own personal information.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a broader note, the lack of transparency leaves little room for
            accountability. The big guys sitting at the top get to decide
            between right and wrong while the common man, who elected them, gets
            no control over the government. This has forced people to lose faith
            in the system and the situation only seems to be getting worse.
          </p>

          <h2>Inefficiency</h2>
          <p>
            Standing in line for a ridiculous amount of time and running from
            door to door to get something done is a regular sight in government
            offices.
          </p>
          <p>
            This situation is aided by the fact that most government employees
            consider their jobs as a safe zone. They get all the benefits and a
            sense of authority as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, many of the sectors have low wages when compared
            to the expenditure of an average working individual. This urges them
            to take bribes from the public.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, almost all governmental programs need the personal
            information of the public enrolling in it. And while the government
            is taking steps to digitize the process of records keeping and form
            filing, this job still remains a painstaking one.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is especially true with money transfers such as fund sanctions,
            pension schemes, reimbursements, and similar situations, where the
            person who needs the fund has to change a few slippers before
            getting what’s rightfully theirs.
          </p>

          <h2>Corruption</h2>
          <p>
            Well, perhaps this part needs the least explanation because this is
            not a new tale to tell. Centralized power almost always comes with
            consequences, and corruption has plagued the system from the start.
            This “disease” has infiltrated into almost every sector you could
            possibly imagine, and from falsifying data to tax frauds to using
            authority as leverage, corruption spans across multiple sectors and
            almost every governmental organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this doesn’t mean that the government employees are the
            only ones to blame. The citizens themselves play a major role in
            fueling corruption.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the day, everyone seems to be looking out for
            themselves and for their own benefits. Instead of collectively
            working for the betterment of a nation, many people commit tax
            evasions, false insurance claims, stage deaths for collecting social
            security, bribe government officials for favors, and the list just
            continues on and on.
          </p>

          <h3>Infringement of privacy</h3>
          <p>
            How safe do you think we really are? Our private data is, in fact,
            one of the least private things that we have.
          </p>
          <p>
            The government knows everything about us and they collect this
            information through various means.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this is not necessarily a bad thing as it would be useful in
            case of a dispute, we don’t really know how they use this
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            The way they do this snooping is quite interesting and alarming at
            the same time. They hide the fact that they are spying on us in the
            name of other services. It’s really easy to even track what we do
            online and deduce a behavioral pattern from it.
          </p>

          <h2>Mismanagement of resources</h2>
          <p>
            There is a huge mismanagement of resources in terms of money and
            other resources happening across sectors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The processes of the government take up a lot of time and labor
            force, and this results in the spending of money.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many government officers forge fake bills for reimbursements and
            take the money for themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the cost calculation for various government projects is
            inaccurate. The funding is either too much or too little. The money
            is being spent and there is no real way of tracking it at all.
          </p>

          <h2>Lack of Digitization</h2>
          <p>
            Right about now, you might wonder, “Is this one really relevant?”.
            Yes, the government has converted almost everything into digital
            form. Most of the filing and records keeping is done digitally
            through online portals. However, this is not a fool-proof process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though everything is done online, the public has to provide
            information over and over again for enrolling in each and every
            government scheme. If the data is digital, then why can’t they just
            dig into the database and retrieve it? This is one of the unanswered
            questions that have been going around for a while now.
          </p>

          <h2>Network vulnerabilities</h2>
          <p>
            Almost all governmental organizations rely on legacy networks for
            internal networking, and these are quite slow when compared to other
            networking systems. The organizations are slowly moving towards
            faster solutions, but at this rate, it would take them several years
            to transition into the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, apart from being slow, these systems are prone to
            security risks. What we need is a system that gets the work done
            quickly and efficiently using the latest technology.
          </p>

          <h2>Failing to ensure rights to citizens</h2>
          <p>
            The system has been largely incompetent in ensuring rights to
            citizens. At times, these are basic human rights that everyone
            deserves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Time and again, we see that the elections come and political parties
            make promises that they don’t keep. Even the ones they do keep takes
            forever to take effect.
          </p>

          <h2>How Blockchain Solves These Problems</h2>
          <p>
            The problems at hand are indeed great, but thankfully, there’s a way
            around.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blockchain is a
            <a class="content-link" [routerLink]="['']"
              ><b>revolutionary technology</b>
            </a>
            that can solve some of the biggest problems in several industries
            and sectors, including the government and public sectors.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, let’s take a look at how we can use blockchain to revive the
            system.
          </p>

          <h2>Enforcing trust through trustless transactions</h2>
          <p>
            One of the major advantages of blockchain technology is that you can
            guarantee trust between the government and the people. Many widely
            use the term “trustless” when it comes to blockchain and this can
            get a bit confusing. What do they really mean when they say
            trustless?
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, blockchain is a technology that ensures trust in all
            interactions and transactions. The word “trustless” doesn’t mean
            that you eliminate trust. It actually means that it reduces the
            amount of trust required by everyone in the system. So, by
            <a class="content-link" [routerLink]="['']">
              <b
                >implementing blockchain in government and public services</b
              > </a
            >, you are actually establishing trust between the government and
            the citizens.
          </p>

          <p>And here’s how.</p>
          <h4>Smart contracts</h4>
          <p>
            Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms and
            conditions of an agreement directly written into the code. These
            programs are a fool-proof way of carrying out tasks and always
            deliver results. For example, let's say that you a retired person
            looking to avail of their pension. In the current system, you’d have
            to file your request at a government office and go through a
            painstaking list of processes before the money actually reaches your
            wallet. If we implement a smart contract here, if you meet the
            criteria to avail the pension, the contract will execute itself and
            you’ll get everything you are owed instantly. Furthermore, since
            there is no paperwork and no human mediator, no one can interfere
            with the whole process.
          </p>

          <h4>Transparency with privacy</h4>
          <p>
            The information once stored on the blockchain database can never be
            tampered with, and it will be available whenever needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can store the public information on a public
            <a
              class="content-link"
              [routerLink]="['/hyperledger-blockchain-development']"
              ><b>blockchain ledger</b>
            </a>
            that everyone can access. For example, criminal records and
            employment records.
          </p>
          <p>
            For sensitive information such as medical records, you can store the
            data on a private distributed blockchain-based ledger and make it
            available to specified persons only.
          </p>
          <p>
            This way the government can access the information they need for
            providing services to the citizens while ensuring rights to their
            citizens. The citizens get to choose whether to disclose their
            private data or not.
          </p>

          <h2>Enhanced Security</h2>
          <p>
            Security is the number one feature of blockchain technology. Hackers
            often target governments trying to snoop into the citizens’ privacy
            and also to access sensitive information. This information can be
            anything from a person’s personal records to confidential military
            plans.
          </p>
          <h4>Protection against hackers</h4>
          <p>
            Blockchain for government and public services add extra layers of
            security that keep hackers away from the data. When you use a
            distributed ledger for storing your data, on a protected network, it
            becomes extremely difficult for hackers to get into the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Usually, hackers only have to access one server to get into the
            system. Blockchain, as the name suggests, is made up of multiple
            blocks. And each block is connected to all the blocks before and
            after it. For a hacker to access the system, they would need to
            change the data on a block as well as the data on every other block,
            to avoid detection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the records on a blockchain ledger are protected using
            something called cryptography. Each entity that makes a transaction
            in the block gets a private key assigned to the transactions they
            make. When a hacker tries to make any changes to the data on a
            block, this key becomes invalid and the peer connection is notified
            instantly. This makes hacking practically impossible.
          </p>
          <p>
            And unfortunately for the hackers, there is no single point of
            weakness. The data itself is stored on multiple databases and not on
            a single server.
          </p>

          <h2>Fighting corruption</h2>
          <p>
            Time and again, we hear stories of corrupt government officials
            tampering with data to hide corruption or to get benefits. Citizens
            even bribe these officials to change the data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, blockchain technology protects your data, not only from
            hackers but from everyone, making falsifying of data practically
            impossible. Additionally, since you can use both public and private
            blockchains for storing data, you can use authentication to choose
            who gets use the data, while maintaining transparency by making
            legitimate data available to the public in real-time. What you see
            is literally what you get.
          </p>

          <h2>Elections</h2>
          <p>
            The elections have always been an issue all over the world. In the
            era of ballots, security was a major concern. Ballot boxes were
            guarded with high levels of security to ensure that the votes were
            not forged.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, this process is done with the help of electronic devices. But
            the problem here is that electronic devices can be easily tampered
            with. We’ve heard several reports of voters clicking on one
            candidate’s button and the vote being cast for the other candidate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blockchain can eliminate this completely. With
            <a class="content-link" [routerLink]="['']">
              <b>blockchain application</b></a
            >, we can ensure that each vote cast is authentic. And the immutable
            storage guarantees that no data is ever lost.
          </p>
          <h2>In A Nutshell</h2>
          <p>
            Blockchain for government and public services is a revolutionary
            idea that can change everything for us. It is effective not just in
            the public sector but also in other sectors such as healthcare,
            insurance, intellectual property, digital identity, food safety, and
            the list just goes on.
