          <h1>Difference between blockchain and bitcoin</h1>
          <p>
            Are you aware of the fact that blockchain and bitcoin are closely
            interrelated but they aren't the same thing? If you one of those who
            make the mistakes then from this article you will definitely learn a
            lot.
          </p>
          <h4>What do you mean by blockchain technology?</h4>
          <p>
            In layman's language, a blockchain is a computer file which is
            specifically designed to store confidential data. Whereas, in more
            technical terms a blockchain is a distributed ledger or a database
            which means that the data within the blockchain can be viewed using
            many computers thereby indicating that it is decentralized. The
            concept of blockchain is new to the world of technology but the
            decentralized data system makes the process unique. In the earlier
            days, databases used to be centralized which means that it remains
            under the direct control of one single entity which can be the
            government or a single entity. Technology has changed over the years
            thereby introducing decentralised databases which can be viewed with
            the permission of all the users. Yes, the method is translucent in
            nature but it is totally protected. This is because hackers do not
            know where to attack as it is handled by so many different users.
          </p>

          <h2>Decentralized and Distributed that sounds interesting</h2>

          <p>
            Cryptopunks are 24*24 pixel art images or unique avatars represented
            as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. There are 10000 Cryptopunks
            available in the market, all with unique characteristics. In simple
            words, one of the best examples of Cryptopunks is NFT.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although it was released in 2017, it gained popularity by some of
            the Cryptopunks sold it for millions of dollars in 2021. Apart from
            this, one of the highlighting attributes of Cryptopunks is that
            everyone can view any one of the Cryptopunks.
          </p>

          <h2>How did Cryptopunks gain popularity?</h2>
          <h4>A Distant Dream for Many</h4>
          <p>
            If the two terms are playing in your mind then you are bound to
            think that it is bitcoin. Well, you're there. Blockchain was
            specifically designed to run bitcoin. It is an honest revelation
            that the two cannot operate without help from one another. Though
            the technical terms are interrelated they aren't the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bitcoin is a digital currency which is decentralized in process
            using which people transfer bitcoins without any third-party
            intervention. Bitcoin is a simple example of cryptocurrency.
            Therefore, it can be said that Bitcoin makes use of the blockchain
            technology to transfer digital currencies but the blockchain is a
            much wider concept than Bitcoin.
          </p>

          <h2>How can the blockchain technology be useful?</h2>
          <p>
            As blockchain and bitcoins are so much interrelated that people took
            time to understand the concept of blockchain. A blockchain has a
            much wider application than a bitcoin and it is much more than just
            cryptocurrencynetworks. The concept and the application of
            blockchain are so vast that people are still taking time to
            understand that the world of business is soon to revolutionize just
            like what the internet did to the world.
          </p>

          <h4>Executing smart contracts</h4>
          <p>
            With the help of Bitcoin people came to know that Blockchain
            provides perfect execution to digital transactions and it also
            provides legal status to digital relations. Smart contracts help in
            the automation of transactions which is sent only after the terms of
            the contract has been accomplished. This saves up a lot of your
            precious time, thereby resolving any kind of argument.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Maintenance of a distributed and a transparent arrangement of
            records
          </h4>
          <p>
            Blockchain helps in the maintenance of a long-term, transparent, and
            a protected file of assets (record of investments can be an ideal
            example) which can be used and seen by all parties in a protected
            manner.
          </p>
          <h4>Analysis of supply chain</h4>
          <p>
            With the help of Blockchain records of goods purchased by which
            customer can be tracked. For example, if an e-commerce company is
            using a blockchain network then with the help of it the company can
            keep a track which goods have been sent from the warehouse to which
            location. Any customer can check the validity of the product sent
            with the help of records stored in the network.
          </p>

          <h4>Acts as evidence of insurance</h4>
          <p>
            Insurance companies are planning to try out blockchain so that they
            can provide information about the proof of insurance. With the help
            of the tools police officers, customers, and insurers can check out
            the insurance coverage without having to wait much.
