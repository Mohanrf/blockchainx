          <h1>What is DeFi? - A new revolution in Fintech Industry</h1>

          <h2>The Know- what DeFi is</h2>
          <p>
            Defi has been trending for a while now. The term has created a buzz
            in the financial market within its two years of launch. The results
            have been glorious enough to attract the investors and shareholders.
            The system based on decentralization of the financial market by
            eliminating the intermediaries is accessible to every individual who
            wants to avail any kind of financial services. Let’s learn more
            about it in the following blog.
          </p>

          <p>
            Decentralized Finance Protocol is that area in cryptocurrency that
            is gaining the highest amount of attention. This mainly refers to
            financial services or smart contracts, which are automated
            enforceable agreements that don't need intermediaries or mediators
            like banks or other financial institutions or a lawyer or online
            blockchain technology instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            DeFi is also sometimes known as 'lego money' because you can stack
            dApps to maximize the returns. Though many of today's dApps are
            niche, future applications could significantly impact everyone's
            day-to-day lives.
          </p>

          <h2>What is DeFi?</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>DeFi </strong> is an acronym used for “Decentralized
            Finance”. The term covers several applications in cryptocurrency or
            blockchain that are organized to disorder the centralized finance
            system and its intermediaries. Decentralized Finance has a
            significant role to play in blockchain, the technology behind
            digital bitcoin. The main advantage of it is, a single central
            source doesn't control it. Centralized systems can make the process
            slow and obstruct direct control over the money. DeFi is much
            clearer because it expands the use of blockchain from simple to more
            complex payment options.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bitcoin is not as same as other digital payment options like PayPal
            and Visa, as these kinds of transactions do not involve any
            middlemen. Cutting out intermediaries from almost all primary types
            of commerce is the most crucial advantage of DeFi.
          </p>

          <h2>Rise of DeFi</h2>

          <p>
            Many of the DeFi applications are built on top of 'Ethereum,' the
            world's second-largest cryptocurrency platform. It is the next step
            towards disruptive financial technology, which began 11yrs ago with
            bitcoin. These decentralized applications are entirely peer to peer,
            without any company or other institution providing the platform.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bitcoin today has successfully changed how financial systems work.
            Bitcoin offered a cheap, economical, swift, easy, and heavily safe
            way of money transfer based on innovative data maintaining
            technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            DeFi is a phenomenon in which decentralized networks' power is
            upgraded to alter the traditional financial way of transferring and
            saving money into one of the distributed data age.
          </p>

          <p>
            Decentralized Finance has jumped up to a place of prominence in the
            last couple of years. The concept started in the very beginning
            during the first days of the cryptocurrency when many platforms were
            initiated to bring various purposes to blockchain or cryptocurrency.
            One of these services also involves d decentralized banks and
            financial firms. Today, people have the option of obtaining loans,
            creating savings accounts, and trade or exchange quickly and safely
            using DeFi services.
          </p>

          <p>
            DeFi seems to be one of the best things to happen to people in
            general from the financial perspective. However, every investment or
            transaction comes with a certain amount of risks. Whatever the risk
            factor may be, the most crucial point of interest is that DeFi
            offers enormous benefits to the public.
          </p>

          <p>There are the most popular types of DeFi applications:</p>

          <p>
            Decentralized exchanges (DEXs): Exchanges on online platforms can
            help exchange any currency, whether they are U.S. dollars or
            bitcoins. DEXs are a different type of money exchange, so that it
            can connect users directly for the dealing of cryptocurrency without
            any intermediary or middleman.
          </p>

          <p>
            Stablecoins: It is a type of cryptocurrency tied to an important
            asset, not a cryptocurrency (e.g., dollar or euro). It is just used
            to stabilize the price.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lending Platforms: These are smart contracts used to replace
            intermediaries such as banks, to exchange money easily.
          </p>

          <h2>What is the DeFi offering?</h2>

          <p>
            Decentralized Finance is offering users control of their assets.
            Though nowadays, banks and fintech firms promise to provide full
            power to the users, we trust them more to manage our funds. But DeFi
            can give you complete control of the assets because it can ensure
            total control because of the decentralization and blockchain
            technology as it terminates interference of intermediaries.
          </p>

          <p>
            DeFi has a future, too, because many financial apps developers are
            willing to expand themselves through decentralized systems of money
            exchange. As all protocols are open source, it allows anyone to
            build new financial products on top of them. Decentralized Finance
            opens a new scope in the financial market as developers across the
            globe can join forces with each other to create unique, better
            products that can bring faster innovation and safer networks.
          </p>

          <p>
            Everyone can store, trade, exchange, and invest their assets more
            safely in blockchain and earn higher results than the traditional
            financial system. Since there are no middlemen taking care of these
            assets, the users have complete control over the investments.
          </p>

          <h2>Core Benefits of DeFi</h2>
          <p>
            The core benefit of Decentralized Finance is easy financial access
            to those isolated from the current digital scenario of the financial
            system. Another potential advantage is the modular framework it is
            built upon - interoperable DeFi applications on public blockchains
            that possess the potential to develop new products, services and
            even financial markets.
          </p>

          <p>
            Decentralized Finance apps do not need any intermediaries or
            mediators. The Decentralized Finance code specifies every possible
            problem or dispute with easy methods, and the users can also have
            full control over the funds at all times. This reduces the costs of
            giving and using these products and allows for a more comfortable
            and safer financial system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another core benefit of DeFi apps is that they can be built in
            advance, so making another framework for cryptocurrency in DeFi
            seems less complicated and secure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another benefit of such an open ecosystem like Decentralized Finance
            is the ease of access for every individual who usually wouldn't have
            been able to get access to digital financial services. Because the
            traditional financial system relies on the middlemen, the services
            are typically not present from locations with low-income families.
            However, with DeFi, the costs are much lesser, and low-income
            individuals can also benefit from a broader range of financial
            services.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now this question may pop up, why the sudden craze of Decentralized
            Finance. One final and most important reason for the sudden surge of
            people investing in DeFi tokens is to avoid being left out of the
            immense explosive growth. Many tickets are worth nothing or close to
            nothing in practical terms, so there's a chance to see a lot of
            exhilaration.
          </p>

          <p>
            In case we like it or not, or we choose it or not, we all are
            gradually moving towards a new financial system that is more
            liberalized and decentralized. It can minimize the risks of digital
            money and spread potential benefits as widely as possible.
