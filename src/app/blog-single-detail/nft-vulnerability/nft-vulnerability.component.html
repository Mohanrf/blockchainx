          <h1>Know about NFTs Vulnerability and Security measures</h1>
          <p>
            NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have caught the attention of consumers
            and businesses around the world. In a very short period, NFTs have
            gained huge popularity and have become one of the most promising
            uses of
            <a [routerLink]="['']">blockchain technology.</a>
            However, they do come with significant security risks and this is a
            large business. They are also part of a massive high-value
            blockchain-based network that could open the door to new security
            threats.
          </p>
          <p>
            NFTs are a booming industry with a lack of regulations and oversight
            by design. Therefore, there is no secret among threat actors that
            legal escape exists in the industry, which would enable particular
            people to operate with exemption in certain scenarios. If you are a
            current owner of NFTs or are thinking of buying, the best way to
            proceed is to prepare yourself for the vulnerabilities and this blog
            helps you to secure your domain.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-left">What is NFT?</h2>
          <p>
            For those who are new to NFT, NFT stands for non-fungible tokens,
            which are unique assets in the crypto world. Just imagine owning a
            home on the blockchain or owning a unique avatar in your favorite
            video game. With NFTs, this may be possible. The growth and clarity
            of NFTs also open up possibilities for trading, staking, and
            providing liquidity. While NFTs are still a new and growing
            technology, they are changing the crypto ecosystem. However,
            anything involving money, technology, and humans comes with
            intrinsic security risks.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-left">How Secure are NFTs?</h2>
          <p>
            The growing popularity of NFT has expanded the effective discussion
            of NFT security. Since it is a new technology, the level of NFT
            security is not so much that it can not guarantee the complete
            security of property investors. One of the major NFT risks
            threatening investors and projects is scams. Malicious actors are
            required to gain access to the popular platform, exchange, or their
            virtual property to steal users' data using the wallet and thus NFT
            affects safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            NFT security largely depends on the ability of centralized platforms
            to preserve the private keys of all assets stored on them. Even when
            platforms implement the most advanced security measures, a serious
            NFT risk is associated with the failure of their users to securely
            store their passwords and other private data, in which malicious
            actors can steal their nonfungible tokens.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, NFTs purchased by individual art lovers may become
            unattainable. When a user buys an NFT, he gets a reference to the
            file where the artwork is stored. This artwork is not logged into
            the blockchain, it can be stored anywhere. NFT platforms can
            supposedly close their windows whenever they want. As a result, the
            user cannot display his file, although it still occurs.NFT security
            also depends on the ability of users to implement critical thinking.
            Malicious actors prefer to organize so-called giveaways that offer
            users NFTs for free. However, users must send a specified amount of
            cryptocurrency to participate in these giveaways. Of course, in most
            cases, users do not receive any NFTs.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-left">What are the key NFT vulnerabilities?</h2>
          <p>
            It is worth remarking that the underlying blockchain technology has
            nothing to do with discord phishing attacks and blockchain can
            control whether a published work of art belongs to the NFT issuer.
            Also, when developing and maintaining your NFT marketplace, you
            should be aware of all potential vulnerabilities.
          </p>
          <p>So what are the major risks of NFTs? Let's find out!</p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Smart contract vulnerabilities</h4>
          <p>
            A
            <a [routerLink]="['/smart-contract-development']">smart contract</a>
            is the main and most important feature of any blockchain. When it
            appears to NFTs, smart contracts assist process transactions and
            manage the transfer of ownership.
          </p>
          <p>
            If smart contracts are programmed well and successfully pass an
            independent audit, it will be extremely hard for attackers to tamper
            with them. On the other hand, if security exposures are unaddressed,
            smart contracts can be influenced to support hackers. NFT holders
            will lose their tokens and huge sums of money, while the reputation
            of the market will be ruined forever.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Marketplace and NFT security risks</h4>
          <p>
            <a [routerLink]="['/nft-marketplace-development']"
              >NFT marketplaces</a
            >
            are based on blockchain technology, they are considered
            decentralized. Some marketplaces are centralized, meaning that
            events are listed in an off-chain database organized by the NFT
            Marketplace. Nifty is an instance of such a marketplace. A
            centralized marketplace typically stores all the private keys of
            digital assets on its platform, so, if an attack occurs, hackers can
            steal a lot of tokens in a short time. In addition, many users
            neglect additional security measures: they set weak passwords,
            forget about two-factor authentication, and click on suspicious
            links.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Cybersecurity issues and NFT fraud</h4>
          <p>
            Hackers always try to access users’ personal information through
            malicious emails. Those emails look like they come from legal
            sources such as Coinbase, for example. Fraudsters inform users that
            there has been suspicious activity on their accounts and they need
            to provide a login and password to assess their identity. The
            scammers then access users’ accounts on the NFT platform and can do
            whatever they need there. The researchers studied the problem and
            found significant security vulnerabilities which allowed scammers to
            hack into accounts and steal crypto from digital wallets after a
            user clicked on a link to gifted NFTs on OpenSea. Luckily, as soon
            as Check Point noted the issue to the platform, OpenSea remedied the
            vulnerabilities.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Authentication process and current concerns</h4>
          <p>
            Conventional art has been used for money laundering for years. NFTs
            can make this process even easier. For the time being, NFTs may be
            anonymous, and you may not know who is behind the artist's nickname
            and avatar. There are no laws or restrictions for NFTs either. These
            realities make NFTs ideal for hiding illegally earned money.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-left">The Most Effective measures to protect NFTs</h2>
          <p>
            In the NFT domain, both the Marketplace and the users have to take
            more precautions to preserve themselves, their tokens, and their
            money. Even if the Marketplace is entirely secure, a small mistake
            on the part of the user – such as not setting up two-factor
            authentication or clicking on a malicious link – will enable
            scammers to reduce users' digital pockets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's discover what NFT projects and marketplaces can do to protect
            their users and themselves.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">
            Instruct your users about necessary security measures
          </h4>
          <p>
            Prevention is better than cure. Whether your users have just joined
            the world of NFTs or are already experienced players in this field,
            it is your responsibility to teach them about security measures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Give your users main security instructions on your platform, for
            example:
          </p>
          <p>
            <i class="bi bi-check2 me-2"></i> Allow two-factor authentication
            (2FA).
          </p>
          <p>
            <i class="bi bi-check2 me-2"></i> Create a powerful password and
            store it offline.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i class="bi bi-check2 me-2"></i> Use merely NFT hardware wallets
            purchased from official manufacturers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hard wallets occur physically and are not connected to the Internet
            until users plug them into a computer. When using a hard NFT wallet,
            the user accepts each transaction by tapping physical buttons. They
            are much safer than hot wallets and protect users from losing their
            crypto and NFT assets. When buying one, make it obvious it is the
            latest firmware version.
          </p>
          <p>In addition, remind your users that they should:</p>
          <p>
            <i class="fas fa-close"></i> Never share your secret recovery phrase
            with anyone, not even your closest friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i class="fas fa-close"></i> Never store your secret recovery phrase
            on any device.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i class="fas fa-close"></i> Never share your screen while using
            your crypto wallet and NFT marketplace.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a marketplace creator, you can also suggest NFT holders using
            Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS), a leading distribution algorithm that
            allows you to protect a secret into multiple parts and store it in
            different locations.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Perform smart contracts audit</h4>
          <p>
            NFT smart contracts should be evaluated for vulnerabilities. Before
            implementing a project, you will need to turn to a smart contract
            audit company to assess the code, analyze the design and
            architecture of smart contracts, and detect any flawed features or
            potential threats.
          </p>
          <p>
            A professional audit assures that your smart contracts are safe and
            that the code is bug-free and works as it should.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">
            Adhere strictly to the decentralization principle
          </h4>
          <p>
            When a platform is unified, all private keys are stored within the
            platform. This puts users' private keys and digital assets at harm.
            Ideally, NFTs should not have permitted private keys to the market
            and should not violate the principle of decentralization. It is also
            recommended that contracts holding NFTs be accessed through
            multi-signature.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-left">Legal Considerations to take into account</h2>
          <p>
            When designing your marketplace, it is essential to take into
            account not only security vulnerabilities but also possible legal
            issues. Here's what you need to consider.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Company formation</h4>
          <p>
            To launch an NFT trading platform, you first want to build a legal
            entity to give strong liability protection for business owners and
            preserve your assets.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Platform Terms of Service</h4>
          <p>
            Since NFT Marketplaces generally contain user-generated content,
            there is a high chance that one user's behavior may negatively
            affect another user.
          </p>
          <p>
            To protect both your company and your users, it is significant to
            carefully design your terms of service. This is a governing legal
            contract between your marketplace and your users, i.e. NFT artists,
            supporters, buyers, and holders.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Terms of Service will protect the company from several legal
            issues. Commonly, the document will include a disclaimer of any
            warranty concerning users, constraints of the company’s general
            liability, etc.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Intellectual-property protection</h4>
          <p>
            Fake NFT assets are everywhere. As the creator of the NFT
            Marketplace, you must assure that your platform can affirm and
            protect the intellectual property rights of each participant:
            creators, buyers, and other parties involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            The copyright usually belongs to the creator of the original
            artwork. If an NFT is created and sold, the buyer will also earn a
            set of intellectual property rights from the producer.
          </p>
          <p>
            When tokenizing an artwork, it is also necessary to take into
            account supporting parties such as studios, record companies,
            producers, etc.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Data privacy</h4>
          <p>
            Developing a privacy policy and publishing it is essential not only
            to comply with legal requirements but also to build trust among your
            NFT community. If your privacy policy is well-drafted, you will
            attain trust and relate to yourself as a developed company.
          </p>
          <p>
            A poorly written and contentious privacy policy can undermine user
            trust in your marketplace. Be transparent about your data
            collection, and users will admire it.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-left">To End things off</h2>
          <p>
            As of today, the majority of NFT scam cases are not associated with
            the blockchain. While the technology is fairly secure, users
            continue to lose their tokens and crypto after clicking on a
            malicious link or because they have not set up 2FA or only used a
            hot wallet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marketplaces need to work harder to assure that they are technically
            secure and that their users are conscious of all protective
            measures. Soon, in the future NFT marketplace will also have to come
            up with solutions to preserve creators and check whether NFTs come
            from genuine authors. At the same time, they will need to stick to
            the principle of decentralization.
          </p>

            you want to build a new platform you can read this blog and it will
            help you bring your ideas to life and build a strong and secure NFT
