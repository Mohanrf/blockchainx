            NFTs, as well as to the NFT market to make trade-making. But, when

          <h2 class="text-left">How do sports NFTs Work?</h2>
          <p>
            The sports NFT market is brand new with tremendous potential and is
            growing rapidly. While there are existing collectibles many excited
            fans can buy and hold physically, NFTs bring them on-chain. Examples
            of collectibles that can be tokenized contain:
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Trading Cards</h4>
          <p>
            Trading card markets run deep in some sports such as baseball,
            hockey, and American football. Aside from the large nostalgic
            feeling they excite, collecting trading cards is a great way to
            support your favorites. Tokenizing trading cards on the blockchain
            gains their value and makes them more secure.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Sports kit</h4>
          <p>
            These include jerseys, wristbands, socks, and boots that everyone
            craves. Bringing sports kits on-chain in the form of NFTs protects
            your right as an owner and gives you more value.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Clips</h4>
          <p>
            There are incredible moments in every sport and therefore, video
            clips are more important than you might think. Want to protect the
            memory of some epic slam dunk or "panenka" shots? You can convert
            them to NFTs and have them for a lifetime.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Memorabilia</h4>
          <p>
            Memorabilia including autographs, medals, and prizes can also be
            brought on-chain as NFTs.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-left">What do sports NFTs aim to solve?</h2>
          <p>
            Non-fungible tokens take advantage of the features of multiple
            blockchains to enhance your playing assets in a variety of ways.
            These include :
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Scarcity</h4>
          <p>
            The scarcity has led to an increase in demand. Tokenizing sports
            collectibles into single units, in particular, adds value to them.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Connects directly to Sports idols</h4>
          <p>
            By eliminating the need for middlemen, NFT provides an open,
            transparent marketplace for fans to engage with their favorites and
            buy their kits directly.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Liquidity</h4>
          <p>
            The NFT marketplace is arguably the most massive thing in crypto
            today, with many users buying and selling collectibles for profit.
            With the number of users drawn towards the NFT market through
            sports, collectibles trading has assumed a new shape.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Royalties</h4>
          <p>
            Sports NFTs trading requires a considerable value for money and
            capable royalties on secondary sales.
