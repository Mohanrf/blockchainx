          <h1>Everything you need to know about Polkadot Parachain</h1>
          <p>
            Starting with Bitcoin, the crypto world is now blooming with
            blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Corda, Cardano, Tron,
            Hyper-Ledger, Polkadot, etc. Among these, the Polkadot is everyone's
            favorite as like its name.
          </p>
          <p>
            The thing that comes to mind when we hear the name Polkadot is its
            high-interoperability feature. Polkadot enables seamless
            interoperability with other blockchains.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short, Polkadot is a blockchain platform and a cryptocurrency. If
            we point out its structure, the Polkadot provides a core network,
            the relay chain, and parallel blockchains called parachains.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is where the term parachain strikes. These Parachains are an
            integral part of the Polkadot ecosystem. If you can recall, Polkadot
            is an interoperable blockchain that can connect multiple
            blockchains, enabling them to communicate with each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parachains are heterogeneous blockchains connected to Polkadot. They
            are interoperable with the Polkadot network and other parachains.
            Let's dive into the parachain network and explore it in detail.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-left">What is Polkadots Parachain?</h2>
          <p>
            In simple terms, Parachains are custom, project-specific blockchains
            integrated within the Polkadot and Kusama networks. The parachain is
            derived from the word parallel chain, because the parachain always
            runs parallel to the Polkadot relay chain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parachains can customize any number of use cases and feed into the
            relay blockchain, the so-called heart of the blockchain. So what is
            a relay chain? The relay blockchain is responsible for and manages
            the shared security, consensus, and cross-chain interoperability of
            the Polkadot network. Parachains integrated into the relay chain
            benefit from the basic features of the relay chain. So, if we
            consider the relay chain as a center, many chains running in
            parallel to the center are called parachains.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Collators & Validators</h4>
          <p>
            A Polkadot network has four main parts, one of which is the
            collators. Collators maintain parachains by collecting parachain
            transactions from users and presenting state transition proofs to
            relay chain validators.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, validators secure the relay chain by validating
            collator proofs, staking dots, and participating in consensus. These
            validators are also one of those four and inclusion in the shared
            state of Polkadot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here we wrap up parachains in short, parachains share the
            cross-chain composability and interoperability of Polkadot. Because
            of this, they can send or receive any type of data or asset with
            other parachains. That way, parachains can support new use cases and
            applications. Additionally, they share and benefit from Polkadot's
            security, scalability, and governance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s together dive into detail on the benefits of Polkadot
            parachains.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-left">The Core Benefits of Parachains</h2>
          <p>
            We always start with interoperability, but it doesn't end there and
            there are many more benefits of parachain.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">High-level of Interoperability</h4>
          <p>
            When we talk about parachains, Polkadot comes to the front of our
            minds, and so does interoperability when we say Polkadot. Here too
            it does not change because it says its most important feature is
            interoperability.
          </p>
          <p>
            The parachains are layer-1 blockchains that can provide full support
            and dominance to blockchain communities and allow them for free
            transactions with other Parachains and external networks. The
            parachains inherently acquire Polkadot’s cross-chain composability,
            which provides any type of data transaction including tokens,
            verifiable credentials, off-chain information from oracles, and
            smart contract calls.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Highly Scalable</h4>
          <p>
            When do we say a blockchain is scalable? It is when they interact
            with each other. So that's where interoperability comes in, doesn't
            knowing that parachains can interoperate mean that they are also
            highly scalable?
          </p>
          <p>
            Parachains have a more decentralized and efficient way to achieve
            blockchain scalability and throughput, as their transactions can be
            propagated and processed in parallel across an ecosystem of
            specialized layer-1 blockchains.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">More Flexible</h4>
          <p>
            Polkadot has given optimum flexibility to parachains. The only must
            followed rule levied by Polkadot is that all the Parachain must
            prove to the Polkadot validators that each of its blocks has
            followed the agreed-upon protocol. In simple terms, Parachain must
            follow the consensus mechanism of the relay chain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each parachain can be designed in its own individualistic way.
            That's why they can run on any type of network, be it private or
            public. Flexibility is behind it all, and they have their own native
            token and governance process.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-left">Governance Process</h4>
          <p>
            The governance process of Parachains is something to highlight,
            giving their community the ability to create their own governance
            features and processes to implement the best system. It can also
            take advantage of Polkadot's built-in transparency if its community
            finds it appropriate and exciting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Governance provides the means to internalize the value of the
            parachain slot and distribute it across all members of the network.
            Permission to the sophisticated on-chain governance mechanisms
            reduces the hard forks of the parachain. In addition, on-chain
            governance also provides accountability and transparency to
            parachain communities.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-left">The Applications of Parachains</h2>
          <p>
            Potential use cases for Parachain through interoperability, design
            flexibility, and scalability. This creates the concept of a Polkadot
            network with parachain as layer-1 blockchain. Let's explore some
            areas where businesses or industries that forward to running their
            projects on parachains are:

          <h2 class="text-left">How Parachain Work on a Polkadot Network?</h2>

          </div>
          <p>
            If we decide to develop a project on Parachain, the first thing to
            do is run Parachain on the Polkadot network. For that, the foremost
            requirement is to lease a slot in the relay chain. Lease slots are
            offered through the parachain slot auction, where interested parties
            are required to bid for slots using Polkadot's native token: DOT. A
            minimum of six months to a maximum of two years for the respective
            team.
          </p>
          <p>
            To participate in a parachain slot auction, interested parties are
            required to lock in the bid DOT amount for their chosen lease
            period. By doing so, after the expiry of the lease, the entire DOT
            amount will be unlocked. However, during the lease period, even if
            the DOT amount is reserved in the original account of the bidder, it
            cannot be used for stacking, transfer, or any other use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Are you interested? Then there are several ways to fund your bids.
            You can self-fund or seek crowd loans, where DOT holders make
            contributions in exchange for certain rewards.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-left">How much does it cost to run a parachain?</h2>
          <p>
            All we need to run a parachain on the Polkadot network is to lease a
            slot. If you ask how much it will cost, the answer is nothing.
            Because the full amount of DOT locked for a Parachain slot is
            unlocked at the end of the lease period.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also means that Parachain can access as much computing power as
            it needs without incurring additional fees or "gas" costs. But
            during the lease period, the DOT remains locked and cannot be used
            for any purpose, so the cost of running a parachain can best be
            described as an opportunity cost.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-left">Parachain In a Nutshell</h2>
          <p>
            Parachains are custom, project-specific blockchains that are
            integrated within the Polkadot network. parachains share the
            cross-chain composability and interoperability of Polkadot. Because
            of this, they can send or receive any type of data or asset with

            applications. Additionally, they share and benefit from Polkadot's
            security, scalability, and governance.
