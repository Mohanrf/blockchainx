          <h1>How can blockchain empower and enrich women</h1>
          <p>
            When we look at the statistics, half of the employees of Binance are
            women. And in India, women take lead in the largest number of crypto
            investors. Many of the women are participating and using their
            talents to open up the space. Additionally, many of the developers
            in the blockchain space are also women. A majority of women today
            agree that financial independence is of utmost importance. This
            makes cryptocurrencies a great tool for women empowerment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Things are changing for the better in the blockchain and crypto
            industry as more women are mastering new professions such as
            investors, in business, analysts, developers, journalists, and
            executives in companies. 2022 is a monumental year for crypto space
            in India. After the annual budget, the legality of the asset class
            received some clarity and legitimacy, which drove in more women to
            the space. One could say that there are more women carrying
            leadership positions in the blockchain and crypto industry now.

          <h2 class="text-left">Women in Blockchain key to Innovation</h2>
          <p>
            Globally, the total female presence in the blockchain ecosystem used
            to be between 1% and 5%. However, we are seeing an increasing number
            of women arising as blockchain influencers. Some are settling their
            technical skills for work, while others are asking the right
            questions to make sure people understand both sides of the coin.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the industry calls for more women to assume leadership
            roles, lowering the gender gap and encouraging diversity. Apart from
            seeing a greater number of women in the industry, the ecosystem
            needs to build a place where women feel appreciated not only for
            their technical prowess but also for their capacity to use design
            thinking in several applications of blockchain technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that women are key to innovation in the blockchain space
            and that blockchain technologyâ€™s mass adoption is almost impossible
            to accomplish unless all minds put their thoughts and experiences
            together. Women are also huge community builders, something that the

            Since the beginning of the blockchain industry, women in blockchain
            have played key roles in enhancing the technology's global impact.

            Women are slowly gaining dominance in the technology sector as they
            currently hold about 20% of the jobs in the technology sector.
            Interestingly, around 17.7% of startups in the tech sector have
            female founders. On the other hand, the participation of women in
            <a [routerLink]="['']">blockchain technology </a>as a whole has been
            quite low. Currently, only 5% of women are involved in the crypto
            sector, with contributions in the roles of investors, developers,
            and founders. In contrast, the male community has higher
            participation in the blockchain space.
