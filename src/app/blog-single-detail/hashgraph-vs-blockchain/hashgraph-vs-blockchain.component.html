          <h1>HASHGRAPH VS BLOCKCHAIN – A Quick detailed Comparison</h1>
          <p>
            Many blockchain alternatives are emerging as the world moves toward
            extremely transparent and highly robust distributed ledger
            technology (DLTs). These DLTs, which are progressively being used by
            companies all around the world, also make it easier to keep track of
            transaction data records.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Hashgraph is one such distributed ledger technology. Because of
            its efficiency, speed, and security, the technology is quickly
            gaining traction. In fact, those who use it, claim that it
            outperforms blockchain technology in several ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, which is actually superior? And, if you use
            <a [routerLink]="['']"> blockchain </a> technology in your apps and
            processes, do you have to be concerned about the growing popularity
            of Hashgraph? We will explore the answers to these questions and
            provide a thorough Blockchain vs Hashgraph comparative analysis
            below. So, read it thoroughly to gain the best insights.
          </p>

          <h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>
          <p>
            A blockchain is a distributed shared database that stores data in
            blocks. Blocks are linked to one another to form a chain known as a
            blockchain.
          </p>

          <h2>Advantages of blockchain</h2>
          <h4>High level of integrity</h4>
          <p>once created, the data cannot be altered or modified by anyone.</p>
          <h4>Full information</h4>
          <p>
            control In a traditional centralized system, the user has no control
            over their own personal information, which leads to higher officials
            or companies utilizing users' personal information for their own
            profit. However, due to blockchain's superior level of security and
            transparency, people have complete control over their information.
          </p>
          <h4>Faster Transactions</h4>
          <p>
            Traditional centralized banks take a long time to execute an
            international transaction. As a result, many consumers are unable to
            rely on traditional banks' slow-moving systems. However, we can
            process transactions on the blockchain in a matter of seconds.
          </p>

          <h2>Disadvantages of blockchain</h2>
          <p>
            Process of Verification It uses a verification mechanism such as
            ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) to confirm that
            the transaction is between two correct nodes. This can be a
            difficult and complex procedure because each node must authenticate
            the user's identity.
          </p>
          <h4>Large Energy Consumption</h4>
          <p>
            It takes a lot of electricity to perform complex computing tasks
            during transactions and even mining.
          </p>
          <h4>High volatility</h4>
          <p>
            The main product of blockchain is a cryptocurrency, which is very
            volatile as its prices fluctuate every second. As a result,
            cryptocurrencies are not widely acknowledged as a worldwide
            currency.
          </p>

          <h2>What is a hashgraph?</h2>
          <p>
            Hashgraph is a blockchain alternative that claims to overcome the
            gaps left by blockchains by employing concepts such as chatter about
            gossip and virtual voting to accomplish faster and more secure
            transactions.
          </p>

          <h2>Advantages of Hashgraph</h2>
          <h4>Security</h4>
          <p>
            Hashgraph claims to deliver the maximum level of security using an
            aBFT system (asynchronous byzantine fault tolerance).
          </p>
          <h4>Fast Transaction</h4>
          <p>
            It can process up to 500,000 transactions per second, making it far
            faster than blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and it executes
            transactions with 100% accuracy.
          </p>
          <h4>Low transaction charge</h4>
          <p>
            Its transaction fee is less than one penny, as compared to Bitcoin,
            which has a transaction fee of between $10 and $30 as of 2021 and a
            transaction can take up to ten minutes to complete.
          </p>

          <h2>Disadvantages of Hashgraph</h2>
          <h4>Open source</h4>
          <p>
            Unlike blockchain, hashgraph is a patented technology owned by
            Swirlds, so developers cannot contribute to it without the company's
            permission.The popularity of blockchains is primarily due to the
            involvement of the developer community in trying to experiment with
            better solutions.
          </p>
          <h4>Uncertainty</h4>
          <p>
            While it claims to be better and faster than existing blockchains,
            it is still unclear whether it can handle the tremendous load that
            has badly harmed networks such as Ethereum.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Hashgraph vs. Blockchain: Key Differences—How are they different
          </h2>
          <h4>Approach</h4>
          <p>
            The major factor that has a big impact is the approach taken. And,
            despite the fact that the basic foundation is the same, these
            technologies take very distinct methods. A Blockchain stores
            information in a linear format, such as blocks connected by a single
            line.At the same time, the hash graph is an acyclic graph used to
            store data. Every node in both has a copy of the ledger, making it
            entirely decentralized.
          </p>
          <h4>Security</h4>
          <p>
            Both technicians provide outstanding security. To secure data stored
            and transmitted through the network, blockchain employs encryption.
            As a result, intruders cannot enter the network and steal
            information.Even if someone tries to tamper with data integrity, the
            signature concept comes into play since it displays invalid
            signatures, alerting nodes to suspicious activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, hashgraphs are built asynchronously. The
            mechanism ensures that the data is secure even if a malicious actor
            attempts to take it. The transaction cannot be changed or edited
            once it has been completed. They both offer the same level of
            security.
          </p>
          <h4>Consensus Algorithm</h4>
          <p>
            Depending on the platform and cryptocurrency type, blockchain has
            several approaches to consensus. There are numerous popular
            consensus algorithms in blockchain, such as proof of work, proof of
            stake, and so on. NEO is another form of algorithm that is based on
            delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance. It is a more advanced variation
            of the PoF and PoS. The Hashgraph, on the other hand, uses a virtual
            voting procedure. Hashgraph is more like a consensus algorithm, but
            experts found it doesn't have anything greater to offer in terms of
            consensus algorithm than blockchain.
          </p>
          <h4>Speed</h4>
          <p>
            The blockchain's speed varies depending on the solution. However, as
            compared to the hash graph, it is slower.Hashgraph can reach up to
            500,000 transactions per second, but this can vary based on other
            factors. Blockchain systems, on the other hand, such as Ethereum and
            Bitcoin, are relatively slow and can only process 10,000
            transactions per second. When it comes to the cause of it, the
            gossip to gossip method makes it possible. With this , less
            information must be sent over the network, which is beneficial when
            more events occur on the network.
          </p>
          <h4>Fairness</h4>
          <p>
            When we compare the fairness of both technologies, blockchain comes
            in second, while hashgraph comes out on top. The miners have more
            control over which orders to process and which to reject. It may be
            unjust to the people who are present on the network, either directly
            or indirectly. Because it assigns random nodes,
            <a [routerLink]="['/hashgraph-development-services']">
              hashgraph technology
            </a>
            is more fair than blockchain technology. It uses time-stamped
            consensus to ensure that no one is affected as a result of the
            transaction order. One of the most praised features of hashgraph is
            its fairness, which was lacking in the blockchain.
          </p>
          <h4>Transaction Price</h4>
          <p>
            The cost of transactions varies on the blockchain, with larger fee
            transactions receiving priority. The transaction cost is typically
            greater than $15, and the transaction speed is limited, ranging from
            4 to 15 seconds. It can go up to $25 to $30 if the transaction speed
            is faster. In the case of hashgraphs, the transaction cost is the
            same. However, the price can vary depending on a number of things.
            The minimal price might begin at $0.0001.
          </p>
          <h4>Efficiency</h4>
          <p>
            Due to the approach used, hashgraphs have been shown to be more
            efficient. The blockchain approach makes it impossible for miners to
            operate on both blocks at the same time. That means the miners must
            discard one of the two blocks. As a result, efforts are wasted, and
            network efficiency suffers. The hashgraph, on the other hand, does
            not rely on blocks and instead operates on events. So it is not
            affected by the problem that exists in blockchain networks.
          </p>
          <h4>Adoption and Development Stages</h4>
          <p>
            When it comes to blockchain adoption and development, there is no
            better technology than blockchain. In comparison to hashgraph, it
            has been in the industry for a long time. There are numerous
            instances where blockchain technology has been proven to be
            successful, such as its support for
            <a [routerLink]="['/dapps-development']"> dApps </a>
            and
            <a [routerLink]="['/smart-contract-development']">
              smart contracts.</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The hashgraph is still a long way from the blockchain in terms of
            adoption and development. Above all, it is still a patent
            technology, and the public version is still in the process. Many
            businesses use hashgraph, but the number is insignificant in
            comparison to blockchain use.
          </p>

          <h2>Which would be better for your business?</h2>
          <p>
            We analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of each technology.
            After learning all of the technicalities, you may be wondering if
            hashgraph will eventually replace blockchain. An honest response is
            still difficult to come by because several business sectors have
            researched blockchain more than hashgraphs. However, hashgraph is on
            its way to reaching various business verticals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on some characteristics, we can say that hashgraph is superior
            to blockchain and has solved the blockchain's difficulties, and vice
            versa. However, based on the exposure and applications, blockchain
            is being widely adopted by numerous businesses and is enjoying
            continued success. We hope to determine which one is the greatest
            over time.

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            Hashgraph is a well-known advanced technique. However, there is no
            guarantee that it will totally replace the blockchain in the future.
            Because Hashgraph is privately held, industry adoption is slow. Do
            you have a clear grasp of the two cutting-edge technologies? If so,
            you may quickly determine which one you like based on your
            requirements. Whether you intend to establish a blockchain or
            hashgraph-based application, the first step is to confer with
            professionals, either a blockchain development company or a
            hashgraph development company, depending on your needs and budget.
