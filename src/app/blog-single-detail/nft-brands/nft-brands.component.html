          <h1>10 Big Brands Jumping On The NFT</h1>

          <p>
            NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are one of the largest trends in the
            industry right now and are set to become an important performer in
            the trillion-dollar marketing industry by 2022. While some assume
            that the growth of NFTs is just the recent shiny new thing, we are
            confident that they are here to keep up and will develop more in the
            years to come. Many businesses have already recognized the large
            potential behind NFTs and can predict more opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            NFTs are still in their beginning, but they have huge possibilities
            to reshape the way brands interact with consumers. The pandemic has
            advanced people’s interest in the digital space and NFT collectibles
            have been jumping all over. The success and information from brands
            getting in earlier will only help them in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a quick rundown of the 10 biggest brands that are jumping on
            NFTs.
          </p>

          <h2>Lamborghini</h2>
          <p>
            Lamborghini has announced its first NFT in collaboration with
            Swedish artist Fabian Ofner. The NFT brings out a space-themed
            design with a Lamborghini car in the atmosphere. The company aims to
            attract youth to the NFT community and capitalize on the current NFT
            trend. The automobile company said it is working closely with Fabian
            Oefner with NFT pro and Sotheby's.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fabian Oefner designed a Lamborghini NFT called 'Space-Time Memory'.
            The image is centered around a space theme and shows a Lamborghini
            being launched from earth into space, while the car is breaking into
            pieces. In addition, the company announced that it will be
            auctioning five NFTs on its website. The duration of each auction is
            75 hours and 50 minutes, which is the 'exact time for Apollo 11 to
            leave earth and enter the orbit of the Moon'.
          </p>
          <p>
            NFTs are fingerprint recognition for digital media. These five
            carbon fiber squares with QR codes assigned by Lamborghini will be
            joined by a special digital artwork. However, the nature of the
            digital media related to these Lamborghini NFTs is not yet known.
            The luxury high-performance car brand is required to reveal more
            details about the NFT soon, including what kind of unique art is
            going on and the artist's name behind it. Its parts, the engine, the
            information, the suspension, and hundreds of nuts and bolts are
            shooting away like the exhaust blaze of a rocket.
          </p>

          <h2>Adidas</h2>
          <p>
            In December 2021, Sportswear giant Adidas announced that its next
            collection will be a mix of digital and physical goods and will be
            sold as NFTs produced with partners such as Bored Ape Yacht Club.
            This is Adidas' first collection of NFTs or non-fungible tokens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adidas is setting the launch as a way to connect with fans and
            engage "at the forefront of creativity." Adidas chief digital
            officer Scott Zalaznik said
            <a [routerLink]="['']">blockchain technology,</a>
            which records the unique signature and ownership of NFT, presented a
            huge opportunity for brands. NFTs went on sale on December 17th for
            0.2 Ethereum, and digital and physical wearables for NFT owners will
            be made available in 2022.
          </p>

          <h2>Coca-Cola</h2>
          <p>
            Coca-Cola's entry into the fast-growing metaverse was a huge hit
            with fans and the crypto community, with the brand's first NFT
            (Non-Fungible Token) collectibles collecting a winning bid of
            $575,883.61 in an online auction. Auctioned in 72 hours as a single
            "loot box" through the open sea marketplace, friendship day-inspired
            NFTs put a virtual-world spin on iconic coca-cola merchandise.
          </p>
          <p>
            The friendship box reimagines an old coca-cola cooler with dynamic
            motion and light that includes three other NFTs: a custom-designed
            coca-cola bubble jacket to be worn in the decentraland 3D virtual
            reality platform; a sound visualizer depicting the recognizable
            sound of enjoying a coca-cola; and a coca-cola friendship card with
            fresh artwork from 1948.
          </p>
          <p>
            The winning member will also collect a real-life, fully stocked
            coca-cola refrigerator. All coca-cola profits from the NFT auction
            will go to Special Olympics International. The coca-cola loot Box,
            which is now split into separate NFTs for secondary sale, is one of
            the top five NFTs ever sold on the open sea. It credits the NFT's
            surprising and pleasing aspects, retro design, and collectibles with
            driving engagement and demand.
          </p>

          <h2>Samsung</h2>
          <p>
            In the early weeks of January 2022, Samsung announced that it was
            planning larger support for NFTs starting with the 2022 TV lineup.
            In its press release, Samsung declared that “With the rising demand
            for NFTs, today's fragmented viewing and buying landscape has never
            been greater.
          </p>
          <p>
            Samsung will initiate the world's first TV screen-based NFT explorer
            and introduce a marketplace aggregator, a groundbreaking platform
            that allows you to browse, buy and showcase your favorite art – all
            in one place. The NFT platform is hoped to be made available as the
            upcoming TVs will start shipping in the months of 2022. And it's not
            finished yet. Samsung has also circulated it's oddly-named '837X'
            virtual world in the blockchain-powered decentraland metaverse in
            January 2022.

          <h2>McDonald's</h2>
          <p>
            McDonald's fast-food chain enters NFT space. It is releasing its
            first NFT collection of 10 giveaway pieces. The collection is
            celebrating the 40th birthday of McRibs sandwiches. According to a
            press release from the company, the fast-food chain will start
            offering NFTs to fans on Twitter from November 1. McRib will also
            begin participating in McDonald's on the same day.
          </p>

          <h2>Ray-Ban</h2>
          <p>
            Ray-Ban is granting the world's first non-fungible token (NFT)
            eyewear, and it was created in collaboration with German artist
            Oliver Latta, also known as extravagant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ray-Ban's iconic aviator glasses have been featured on NFT, and
            fashion united UK reports that the eyewear company is auctioning the
            item through the<a [routerLink]="['/nft-marketplace-development']">
              NFT marketplace,</a

            open sea. The eyewear company has achieved a new milestone for its
            irreplaceable token eyeglasses as it is also Ray-Ban's first virtual
            product that will bring fans into the world of the Metaverse.

            non-fungible token (NFT) and since the door has been opened, the
            eyewear brand is required to issue more NFTs in the future.
          </p>

          <h2>Gucci</h2>
          <p>
            Gucci is the latest fashion brand to associate with NFT with the
            launch of a limited series of digital collectibles. Italian luxury
            fashion brand Gucci is the latest to make its way into Web 3 with
            the upcoming drop of 10 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on February 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NFT has been created in collaboration with cult toy brand
            superplastic and co-designed by Alessandro Michele, head of design
            at Gucci. Each NFT will be provided with a ceramic sculpture
            handmade in Italy and co-designed by Gucci. Super Plastics is a

            market and releases NFTs. Superplastic was founded in 2018 by
            Kidrobot founder Paul Budnitz. Gucci tweeted about the roadmap and
            launch of a channel to encourage open conversation with the
            community about what's additional in the metaverse.
          </p>

          <h2>Formula 1</h2>
          <p>
            Formula 1 launched the NFT which included car parts and drivers, in
            an Ethereum-powered gaming initiative known as "F1 Delta Time".
          </p>
          <p>
            The F1
            <a [routerLink]="['/nft-gaming-platfrom-development']">NFT game </a
            >was created by Animoca Brands, a company that worked with several
            other brands to launch NFT. Other NFTs that Animoca brands have
            assisted in creating NFT include formula E. Last December, the first
            F1 NFT share was sold for approximately $223,000. At the time, it
            was one of the most expensive NFTs to launch. However, this record
            has since been broken as the demand for nfts has grown massively.
          </p>

          <h2>Reddit</h2>
          <p>
            Reddit is reportedly aiming to add a feature that will let its users
            show their non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as profile pictures. This
            feature will be related to the one that twitter initiated earlier
            this month. However, as per the report, the details regarding the
            NFT profile picture feature of Reddit are yet to be confirmed. Last
            year, Reddit dubbed its NFT CryptoSnoos. The report says that users
            will be able to use CryptoSnoos and other NFTs as profile pictures
            on Reddit. Reddit did not declare when the feature would be
            available.
          </p>
          <p>
            In June 2021, Reddit confirmed CryptoSnoos NFTs. Limited-run NFTs
            are built on Ethereum. Ethereum rate in India at 4:57 PM IST on
            January 27 was Rs. 1.98 lakhs.
          </p>

          <h2>NBA</h2>
          <p>
            One of the major brands entering the NFT is the NBA. While it hasn't
            entered the sector directly, the NBA top shot is one of the most
            loyal NFT marketplaces in the sports sector. This marketplace works
            in selling top basketball moments. It has enjoyed incredible growth
            in the last year, selling in lakhs. Some of the players shown in
            moments sold on NBA top shots include Lebron James and other iconic
            players.
          </p>
          <p>
            While it is unclear whether the NBA will eventually launch its NFT
            or NFT marketplace, NBA top shot remains the top NFT invention in
            this area.
          </p>

          <h2>Bottom line</h2>
          <p>
            Each of these brands is making something unique to the list by
            launching NFTs. NFTs are not only allowing these firms to connect
            with their fans better but are also attracting new funding. Some
            companies are even using some of these funds for social
            responsibility initiatives, lending them an edge over their
            competitiveness. It is also a way to keep these brands alive by
            being digital-savvy and NFTs are also helping these brands attract a
            new type of audience.
