          </p>
          <p>
            Exactly. That's how Blockchain in Supply Chain works, instead of
            beating the bushes, tracking orders, maintaining paper works, and
            more of a tidy, tiring, and long time-consuming traditional
            proceeding. Blockchain-based Supply chain management - get to know
            how effectively you could turn your business with the trend.
          </p>
          <h2>Working Of Supply Chain Management</h2>
          <p>
            The Supply chain actively streamlines a company or businessâ€™s
            supply-side operations. Starting from the planning phase to the
            post-sale and the service is extended up to receiving customer
            satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Supply chain management controls the entire production flow.
            They have a track over the raw materials and proceed until the final
            product is manufactured, dispatched, and reach the destinations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Logistics is a part of the supply chain and not the entire process
            which we have to understand. The traditional method of supply chain
            management involves planning, sourcing, manufacturing, delivering,
            and after-sale service control, centrally over the supply chain.
          </p>
          <p>
            The process is initiated by identifying how to meet customer needs
            and choosing suppliers to source materials. Manufacture it and take
            it out to the market, deliver it to the end customer, receive
            feedback, and the flow continues in a circle. In case of repair,
            return, and any issue in terms will be also traced and to do the
            needful is what it demands to meet customer satisfaction. Which is
            the ultimate goal of any production.
          </p>
          <p>
            The SCM systems today are managed using the software. The entire
            process is tracked in it, including goods and services, warehousing,
            inventory management, order completions, information tracking and
            product delivery, and so on till filling up customer satisfaction
            forms.

          <h2>The Current Technological Improvement In SCM</h2>
          <p>
            Vitalizing on the current and happening technologies like Artificial
            Intelligence (AI), robotics, and blockchain the SCM operates on
            these. They combine and collaborate with the data provided through
            various sources, the distribution tracks flows via the value chain.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Supply chain is strictly a physical functional system that
            interlinks data over one another including network assets, data,
            activities, etc. Utilizing AI algorithms it makes the business easy
            and Convenient to extract large data from the data sets of the
            active inventory, automate warehouse processes, critical sourcing
            connections, delivery enhancing, the time involved, increase
            potential customer experience, increase customer satisfaction and
            proportionally the sales rate also.

          <p>
            Robotic technology contributes on a mass scale, eliminating heavy
            manpower needs, as most of it is automated. Usually the picking,
            packing, raw material delivery, good manufacturing, moving and
            shifting items, scanning, and many others are automated or
            robotically guided and guarded.
          </p>
          <p>
            In major production hubs, e-commerce giant robots and automated
            processes take up the majority of the task. Thereby reducing time
            constraints and workload.

          <h2>Improvement in Supply Chain Management Via Blockchain</h2>
          <p>
            Eliminating the barriers in the traditional supply chain management
            system, the Blockchain-based supply chain ensures it works and
            updates automatically with enhanced traceability and transparency
            all over the supply chain network.
          </p>
          <p>
            Supply chains on Blockchain work on Private and permission-based
            entities limiting their operators, and actors, they are not
            restricted yet the users are limited to alteration but open to data
            access.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are four key players in a
            <a [routerLink]="['']"> Blockchain-based Supply Chain</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Registrants provide the network actors with their unique
            identities.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Standard organizations are those that develop blockchain rules
            and technical indicators, and fair trade schemes, and ensure to be
            environmentally friendly.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Certifiers certify the individuals in the supply chain, which
            helps in categorizing.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Actors are the registered auditors or certifiers certified by
            participants or actors ensuring credibility in the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here we shall all have this question: how is it possible to track
            the entire management flow and structure of a product in the supply
            chain?
          </p>
          <p>
            Smart contracts do all this. As the concerned person of the product
            creates a smart contract conditioned with its operations. When it's
            sold or bought by a different actor, it's processed via the
            condition. And implying on the records are further added in the
            space. The transaction information covers all the details of the
            participants, and actors along with their duties and process. It's
            made transparent in the value chain.
          </p>
          <p>
            The vitality of transparency in the blockchain network is open to
            all categories, its nature, quantity, quality, location, ownership,
            product, dimension, and a lot more are conveniently tracked. This
            helps the customer to track and take custody of their purchases and
            analyze the process of authenticity as a whole. Tracking from raw
            material to end sale, the reliability of the organization is built
            on par, thus contributing to the wider and future causes.

            Making the global supply chain efficient with the ability for
            companies to make complete interactions in the space without the
            interference of the middleman. Blockchain technology supports this
            well. Moreover, the network facilitates a complete integration of
            financial and logistic services and collaborates very keenly and
            smooth with the data and the stakeholders
          </p>
          <p>
            With an integrated solution, a lot of time and energy are saved. In
            the case of integrated payments, the process, authentication, and
            surety are all properly checked and timely movements are ensured.
            With blockchain smart contract integration, the organization can
            claim and compile legal procedures easily. There are high chances of
            being benign far from counterfeiting, fraud, taxes confusions, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The new way of integrating with radio frequency identification tags
            using electromagnetic fields makes identifying and tracking much
            more convenient. They are used for compiling product information and
            verifying their ownership or possessions, thus increasing automation
            in the value chain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Transparency, on the other hand, blockchain is doing it over a
            period now, and it's a pro. The records cannot be erased,
            manipulated, miss made, or anything! And this makes the best deal
            for the supply chain. With security logins, the supply chain
            logistics are keenly tracked and Traced. With source tags, from raw
            materials to feedback, the identity is on it, and cannot be erased.
            Tracking can be done legit here, thereby increasing accountability
            and mitigating illegal activity.
