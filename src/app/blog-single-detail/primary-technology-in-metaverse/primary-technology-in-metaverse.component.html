          <h4 class="text-left">
            Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)
          </h4>
          <p>
            Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) can provide us with
            an immersive and fascinating 3D experience. These are our access
            points into the virtual world. But what is the variation between AR
            and VR?
          </p>
          <p>
            AR uses digital visual elements and characters to morph the actual
            world. It is more susceptible than VR and can be used on nearly any
            smartphone or digital device with a camera. Through AR applications,
            users can view their surroundings with interactive digital visuals,
            as we have in the mobile game Pokémon Go. When players open the
            camera on their phone, they can view Pokémon in a real-world
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            VR works contrarily. Like the Metaverse concept, it generates a
            completely computer-generated virtual environment. Users can then
            evaluate it using VR headsets, gloves, and sensors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The way AR and VR work illustrates an early model of the Metaverse.
            VR is already creating a digital world that includes imaginary
            visual content. As its technology becomes more developed, VR may
            broaden the Metaverse experience to include physical simulation with
            VR devices. Users will be able to feel, listen and interact with
            people from other parts of the world. Considering the hype in the
            Metaverse, we can require more Metaverse companies to invest in AR
            and VR equipment development shortly.

          <p>
            The ultimate set of technologies powering the Metaverse includes 3D
            reconstruction and the Internet of Things, or IoT. 3D reconstruction
            or spatial computing is significant in creating realistic locations
            in the Metaverse. It helps to maintain photorealistic buildings,
            objects, and physical locations in the Metaverse while emerging the
            common laws of physics and science.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, the use of IoT as one of the key technologies for
            Metaverse development can facilitate the connection between the
            Metaverse and many real-life devices. As a result, 3D reconstruction
            and IoT can help the creation of the Metaverse as a digital world
            that is an imitation of our actual world.
          </p>
