          </p>
          <p>
            If you are planning to create your NFT marketplace, then you should
            be aware of and avoid some of the mistakes that everyone makes. Here
            we point out a few of them, read this blog to learn more.
          </p>

          <h2>What is NFT Marketplace?</h2>
          <p>
            NFT Marketplace is a blockchain-based online platform for buying and
            selling Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Anyone can buy or sell any
            digital assets or NFT tokens here using NFT cryptocurrency. This
            market is used to produce NFT tokens or any other digital assets and
            also to store, display and show trading. The main difference between
            this NFT marketplace and the traditional market is that it is a
            digital market where you can trade digital assets.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are wondering why there is a need for an NFT marketplace,
            here is the answer. NFTs are digital tokens that hold ownership and
            authenticity over an art, game, audio, video, or any other artistic
            output. In the NFT market, these tokens or digital assets can be
            bought or sold.

              NFT Marketplace</a
            >
            is all about. Without further ado, let's get to our point.
          </p>

          <h2>Working steps of the NFT marketplace</h2>
          <h4>1. Signing Up</h4>
          <p>
            All you need to start your work in the NFT marketplace is a crypto
            account. First, create your account and then link it to a supported
            digital wallet. These are the initial steps you need to take and
            enter your wallet password to complete the process using your
            wallet.
          </p>

          <h4>2. NFT Buying</h4>
          <p>
            NFT buying is not a big deal. You can buy the NFTs through auctions
            or upfront for a fixed cost. In some cases, you can try to bargain
            for a lower price. All you need is a good understanding of the types
            of NFTs to buy and their value in the market.
          </p>

          <h4>3. Selling NFT</h4>
          <p>
            Selling NFTs is more challenging than buying them, especially if it
            is created by a user. You can sell your NFTs through an NFT
            marketplace where you enter a preset price. Or you can sell it
            through NFT auctions. The platform will then verify the asset. Once
            approved, the item will be put up for sale.
          </p>

          <h4>4. Creating an NFT</h4>
          <p>
            The best platform for developing such valuable assets is Ethereum.
            If you are going to create your NFT, you might want to start there.
            First, what you require is an ERC-721-compatible Ethereum wallet.
            Under that, you have Metamast, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet.
          </p>
          <p>
            After these steps, you can access and use certain platforms. Then
            you can start minting your NFts.
          </p>

          <h2>What should you avoid while building an NFT marketplace?</h2>
          <h4>Not following proper NFT guidelines</h4>
          <p>
            Nowadays, the most famous and widely used NFT standard is
            <a [routerLink]="['/erc20-token-development']"> ERC-721.</a>
            So if you're planning to build an NFT marketplace, make sure it
            follows the ERC-721 guidelines. An NFT must follow the structure and
            naming scheme specified by the ERC-721 standard when generating data
            or metadata. By doing this, you ensure that NFTs generated in your
            marketplace are accessible to other marketplaces.
          </p>

          <h4>1. Receive data from an unstable database</h4>
          <p>
            Storing your data in a digital ledger is much safer than storing it
            in a database. Anyone working on the backend of the system can
            change the data if you are storing the marketplace information in a
            database which can be modified. On the other hand, the data of a
            digital ledger is immutable. As a result, it provides complete
            transparency and cannot be altered or erased.
          </p>

          <h4>2. Backend Writing Operation using private keys</h4>
          <p>
            In NFT marketplaces, transactions can be initiated from the front
            end or the back end. To be highly focused, during the frontend
            process, users sign transactions using their private key stored in
            their crypto wallet. What is likely to happen here is that the
            platform developers working on the backend use user private keys to
            run the backend process.
          </p>

          <h4>3. Inaccurate smart contract architecture</h4>
          <p>
            It's well-defined that a smart contract in the NFT marketplace
            accomplishes all the operational functions. If any action has to be
            done is based on smart contracts. These smart contracts trigger each
            action. For this reason, they are critical to how NFT marketplaces
            operate. It is mandatory to take care of and be focused while
            developing a smart contract.
          </p>

          <h4>4. Not implementing proper NFT fee</h4>
          <p>
            Every marketplace has its type of commission, whereas in the case of
            an
            <a [routerLink]="['/nft-marketplace-development']">
              NFT marketplace
            </a>
            you have two choices royalty fee and the marketplace commission.
            When creating an NFT marketplace, these two commissions will help
            you and the artist earn more money.
          </p>

          <h4>5. Using third-party APIs</h4>
          <p>
            It's much better & safer to hold your important information
            regarding your NFTs in third-party APIs. All knowledge about NFT
            collections, transactions, users, etc is encapsulated in an NFT API.
            So you can retrieve an NFT's price, metadata, ownership information,
            exchange information, and more via APIs.
