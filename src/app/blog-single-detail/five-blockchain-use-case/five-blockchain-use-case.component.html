          <h4>In carving the future 5G</h4>
          <p>
            A large percentage of the devices that we use today are IoT devices.
            So, connectivity is the main issue. That's why the concept of 5G
            arises. The 5G will allow the devices to connect instantly and
            frictionlessly without any suffering from current latency issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            How do we implement these innovative ideas through blockchain? Here
            a
            <a [routerLink]="['']">blockchain-based solution </a>
            can help you by creating a smart contract. It can make the
            provisioning between networks and the end user seamless. By
            enforcing dynamic rules and contracts over these networks,
            blockchain can also release discounted rates for better connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also some security concerns surrounding 5G. To secure your
            data received on connected devices must be trusted and free from
            tampering. To help 5G reach its full potential and protect against
            large-scale security breaches, blockchain can ensure data transfer
            is non-disruptive, decentralized, and verified in real time.
          </p>

          <h4>Securing customer identities</h4>
          <p>
            Every user registering for the first time with a telecom company has
            to go through a sign-up process. In that process, your personal or
            sensitive data is required to create an account. Data stored in
            another third-party storage is a big risk. However, customer
            information can be placed at risk of inefficient management, fraud,
            or hacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hacks and attacks are happening every time, but each telecom company
            is focused on how to overcome this menace with 5G. This is where
            innovative blocking technology comes in.
          </p>
          <p>
            With high security, the customer identities are stored in a
            decentralized and tamper-proof ledger rather than being stored with
            a third party. It is also a technology that is inherently based on
            cryptography. It enables providers to increase security and reduce
            legal costs and brand damage associated with data breaches.
          </p>

          <h4>Automation of Data Roaming</h4>
          <p>
            The next obvious use case in telecom is related to roaming and
            settlement. What bothers consumers is the roaming charges. Of
            course, yes, many intermediaries are involved in making sure
            mobile/data networks are accessible if you are traveling outside the
            country. It's inefficient, expensive, and gives the customer an
            inconvenient user experience. Moreover, any issue that arises from
            the settlement of bills or unexpected charges while using roaming
            can often take months to weeks to resolve.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can easily be overcome using blockchain technology because the
            theory of blockchain methodology is to avoid intermediaries by
            converting any centralized technology into a decentralized one.
            Using this technology telecom providers can create smart contracts
            that are executed without human intervention, making for a seamless
            automated experience.
          </p>

          <h4>SLA Monitoring</h4>
          <p>
            Service Level Agreements In short SLAs are critical to the telecom
            sector, but their monitoring is often inefficient and subject to
            delays and disputes. Many telecom organizations are investing in the
            automation of SLAs to solve this problem, although this can involve
            manual processes. Hence they become inefficient and do not meet the
            requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blockchain smart contracts can overcome all these issues. And many
            companies are using smart contracts to clarify the conditions of
            SLAs and to make monitoring more transparent.
          </p>

          <h4>Construct easy MNP (Mobile Number Portability)</h4>
          <p>
            Mobile Number Portability or MNP has been available to consumers for
            quite some time and is a service that is often fraught with
            difficulties and delays. This is usually a disconnect between
            providers who hold or need additional information to complete the
            transfer. This can lead to frustration for customers and delayed
            onboarding for service providers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Smart contracts can automate SLA monitoring and resolve roaming
            disputes, as well as accelerate the MNP process. Blockchain can act
            as a network to allow all providers to access the same information.
          </p>

          <h2>Everything in a nutshell</h2>
          <p>
            Like other industries, blockchain technology Telecom industry is
            revolutionizing the too. It provides automation, efficiency, MNP,
            supporting SLAs, etc. These are the use cases that scratch the
            surface of
