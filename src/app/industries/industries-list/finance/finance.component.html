          <p>
            In the year 2008, Blockchain came into existence. Bitcoin was the
            first digital cryptocurrency. As time passes by innumerable
            industries are recognizing the advantages of blockchain technology.
            The finance industry is getting the hang of the importance of
            blockchain technology.
          </p>
          <h3>How is blockchain technology defined?</h3>

          <p>
            A blockchain is a technology in which a series of changeless data is
            stored and handled by a set of devices. No single business company
            owns any of the blockchains. The blocks of data, which are also
            known as blocks, are guarded and chained to one another using
            chains. The main reason why blockchains have gained so much
            importance is that the entire process is decentralized. The database
            stored is completely secured, and no one has any access to it. No
            one can touch the data as it is unchangeable and transparent;
            therefore, keeping track of the data becomes next to impossible.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What is the three main support system of blockchain technology?
          </h3>

          <h4>Decentralization</h4>

          <p>
            Before Bitcoin and BitTorrent were introduced, the entire process
            was decentralized. Centralization means that if you are a user then
            you can gain access to anyone's data by seeking permission from the
            single entity. Banks can serve as the best example of the
            centralized process. If you require transferring an amount to a
            third party, then you are required to consult the bank. Another
            example of the centralized process is when you ask for queries from
            Google and are then asked to wait. Google gets back to you by
            retrieving information from the server. Though the process has
            served people for years, it has caused serious damage to society at
            large. This is because all the data series are saved and protected
            on one server. It's an easy job for hackers to gain access to all
            this crucial data. There is no system up-gradation as such. If there
            was any, then the entire process would have stopped. When a
            centralized entity closes, there is no way of retrieving crucial
            data. If any centralized institute is corrupted, it loses all access
            to the data. This is a serious threat to users. <br />
            On the other hand, when it comes to the decentralized process, the
            data is not securely accumulated within one single organization.
            Within a decentralized network, if you want to connect with any of
            your friends, you can do so immediately from your own space. This is
            the main concept behind the invention of Bitcoin. Do you want to
            transfer money to a relative? Well, that's an easy task. You can do
            so from your comfort zone.
          </p>

          <h4>Clarity</h4>

          <p>
            The concept of transparency is misunderstood by a lot of people.
            Some say that blockchain are secure, while others have the view that
            they lack clarity. For example, if you are a part of the blockchain
            and you are about to check out another user's transaction history
            then it would be represented by an address. This means that you do
            not get to know the private details of the person, but you can view
            his transactions. The transparency offered by the decentralized
            system is immensely growing in the financial industry. It is the
            icing on the cake. <br />
            If you would like to know from the angle of cryptocurrency, then you
            can find out how the institute is transacting because you have all
            the details. This forces centralized institutions to be authentic
            with their details. However, it is just a mere example. You are
            fully aware that none of the companies will transact using
            cryptocurrencies. If they were to do so, then all their transactions
            wouldn’t take place within this single network.
          </p>

          <h4>Unchangeability</h4>

          <p>
            Changelessness implies that once something has been fed into the
            blockchain network, the data is unchangeable. No one can mess with
            the data entered. How many fraud cases can be curbed in the
            financial sector if this process is followed? If a hacker gets to
            know that the data is unchangeable, then a lot of customers'money
            can be saved. This is the main reason why the cryptographic hash
            function came into existence. Hashing refers to the grasping of an
            input string of any width and producing an output of a particular
            width. In the process of hashing, it doesn't matter how long your
            input is, but your output has a permanent length. In such a
            situation, no one is required to remember the input as the length
            can be very long. You must be aware of the output which is
            particular in width. This makes mentoring easier.
          </p>

          <h4>Avalanche Effect</h4>

          <p>
            This is a property of the cryptographic hash function. When you make
            minor changes in the input, even then you are bound to receive an
            output massive in nature. For example, there are three blocks, and
            each block contains a set of data. If a hacker tries to tamper with
            the data in block three then the output produced will result in
            unimaginable results. This is bound to affect block 2 and then block
            1. The entire chain is now broken and dismantled. This is exactly
            how blockchain technology attains stability.
          </p>

          <h3>How is blockchain affecting the finance industry?</h3>

          <p>
            The blockchain technology can change the entire banking industry.
            The banking industry is adopting the blockchain technology rapidly.
          </p>

          <h4>Rapid Cross Border transactions</h4>

          <p>
            People are finding it difficult to transfer money internally within
            a bank. The average time taken to transfer within the same bank can
            cost you 2 to 5 working days. Now, this is truly insane. This is a
            huge concern in the 21st century. Innumerable people are working in
            remote areas and their salary is given to them by making a bank
            transfer. Most of the time, the money doesn't arrive on time. If you
            are a freelancer, by any chance, then you will know the real pain.
            Bank-to bank SWIFT transfers can cost you a lot of time. PayPal is
            the worst medium for sending and receiving money. Why does this
            happen? If the company releases the pay on Thursday, it reaches you
            on Monday because banks remain closed on weekends. The process takes
            a long time because the system is centralized.Blockchain, on the
            other hand, is a decentralized procedure that doesn't involve any
            form of centralized institution. Moreover, all the processes are
            conducted by the users themselves, saving both time and money. The
            transactions are completed within seconds, unlike at banks, which
            take up to 2 to 5 days.
          </p>

          <h4>Inexpensive KYC</h4>

          <p>
            Where do you think a financial institute gives up a lot of money?
            Well, it's nowhere else but in complying with the Know Your Customer
            (KYC) regulations. £40m is spent by a financial institute every year
            on an average for KYC Compliance. The cost can also go up to £300m.
            J.P. Morgan has spent a large sum of £1.6 billion on its compliance
            department. In addition to this, 13,000 people have been employed to
            monitor regulatory transformations. Employees working in corporate
            stated that bringing clients on board can take up to two months. Why
            don’t banks shift away from this offline procedure of transactions?
            This is because some changes or others are always coming up when it
            comes to complying with regulations. Other than that, most of the
            banks still make use of the traditional paper system. The procedure
            of compliance is done but by using papers.
          </p>
          <p>
            How does blockchain technology help? Self-sovereignty is the main
            idea behind blockchain technology. It means that a person has the
            ownership right to his or her body and soul. This concept is in a
            fault-finding condition now. Every organization that you get to see
            in today's world has an online presence. Online scams increase due
            to their siloed existence. When you provide your details in the
            blockchain network, you can be assured that they are safe. How would
            KYC become cheaper because of that? For example, you visit a bank
            for the opening of a bank account. You are asked to provide the bank
            with all the private details and also give access to it.
          </p>

          <h4>Trade Finance</h4>
          <p>
            As reports state, there are innumerable parties that are involved in
            trade finance. Due to the large number of parties involved in the
            process, the entire process becomes destructive and sluggish. The
            general tendency of the parties lies in mistrust, which results in
            the involvement of central institutes. Smart contracts on the
            blockchain can resolve such a critical issue.
          </p>

          <h4>Cryptographic Hash Functions</h4>
          <p>
            Transactions serve as input and are processed over a hashing
            algorithm, thereby producing an output of immovable breadth. This
            process takes place over financial platforms like Bitcoin. Being
            deterministic means it does not matter how many inputs you have
            passed through a hash function; the output remains the same. It
            would have been really hard to keep track of the different hashes
            produced every single time. Pre-image resistance states that it is
            really difficult to figure out the input with the help of the
            produced output. Though it is not entirely infeasible, the process
            is annoying and can kill a lot of your time. The snowball effect
            claims that minor changes in the input can result in disastrous
            changes in the output.
          </p>
          <p>
            Smart Contracts are automated in nature. This feature makes the
            procedure simpler. Procedures can take place only when they adhere
            to certain codified rules and regulations. No human intervention is
            required. Smart contracts are based on instructions. Only when the
            instructions coded in the first set are executed then the second
            step follows. For example, there is a vending machine, and you
            insert a coin in it. Accordingly, you press the buttons of your
            choice and press OK. The items are then processed out, and you get
            to have them. No third parties were involved in this act of vending
            machine. Until and unless you are done with the first step the
            second step couldn't be executed. Smart contracts eradicate third
            parties, thereby cutting out a lot of your costs. No trust-building
            is required as there is no third party involved in the entire act.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What are the hurdles that the blockchain technology must overcome?
          </h3>

          <p>
            Financial institutions have a vast amount of transactions to
            process. The blockchain technology hasn't yet developed that
            architecture. Once the architecture is built, the financial industry
            is good to go. The dependability of the technology on public-key
            cryptocurrency must be removed. A user can get a hold of the assets
            only with his or her private key. The keys, either public or
            private, can vanish. Such a displacement will lead the owners to
            transfer their assets documented on the blockchain network.
            Interoperability problems can create a menace for financial
            institutions.
          </p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>

          <p>
            The blockchain technology and the financial industry can go hand in
            hand once the obstacles are removed from its path. If the benefits
            of blockchain technology are taken into consideration, then the
            financial industry can gain a lot.
