          <h3>What is supply chain management?</h3>
          <p>
            A supply chain, in easier words, is called a distribution system.
            Supply chain management deals with planning the transit of the
            [product until it reaches the final customer, it includes processing
            of material, packaging, warehousing, delivery, wholesalers, and
            retailers too.
          </p>
          <p>
            This management of the flow of goods require resources in the form
            of human labour, raw materials, machinery, organisations, entities
            as well as technology. In other words, it is a full-fledged system
            that starts from building a commodity and making it reach its final
            customer.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What are the current problems faced in the current system of
            management?
          </h3>
          <p>
            If we look on a global scale, the demand is rising on a greater
            level and hence, a product has to be made readily available. The
            demand for high speed, more volume and cheap consumption is
            increasing day by day. This fast consumer pattern has been
            compromised with the value of an ethical supply chain. The current
            system of flow of goods, information and financial capital include
            both uses of manual and online data which is prone to:
          </p>
          <h4>Human errors</h4>
          <p>
            While entering the data manually there could be a lot of mistakes
            like writing down of wrong digits or codes, not including a product
            in the cart, inability to check each and every product and inability
            to check the quality of raw materials etc.
          </p>
          <h4>Are difficult to track down</h4>
          <p>
            As today’s products use a lot of ingredients and components, it is
            really too hard to track that what component has an error. For
            example, if we take a smartphone, there are parts as small as a
            microchip fitted inside of it. If there is a component that is
            defective and fitted in it, it is nearly impossible to know which
            part has a defect and since these parts are made by different
            producers, it becomes more difficult to track the exact part that is
            causing errors.
          </p>
          <h4>Corruption</h4>
          <p>
            The major problem in running a complex supply chain is that the
            vendors of every stage must be trusted. Differently, any
            organisation must trust that the supplier of raw material is
            delivering the right product, the delivery department is maintaining
            the safety standards and there are 100% dedicated and hardworking
            participants in the chain. However, humans are not too much
            trustworthy and the system is prone to corruption. Some basic cases
            may include, mixing up of different materials while collecting raw
            materials, hoarding, black marketing, supplier acting like a
            monopolist, exploitation of resources and window dressing of
            accounts etc.
          </p>
          <h4>Costs</h4>
          <p>
            The traditional system includes four major costs namely,
            procurement, transportation, inventory and quality costs. These
            costs include the cost of manufacturing, collecting raw material,
            fuels required to run daily operations, human costs as well the cost
            of disposal that is even after the production is complete there can
            be errors like quality or a defective product is manufactured and
            hence the entire lot will be scraped off, leading to a major loss to
            the firm. Such costs are at times difficult for the firm to bear.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we can see that the well-being of a supply chain is critical to
            any business, the current system is quite outdated and requires a
            revamp.
          </p>
          <h3>Here the need of blockchain arises</h3>
          <p>
            The blockchain system is a full ledger system that functions on
            blocks and nodes for saving data. This technology was developed by
            the developers of cryptocurrency for safe and secure transactions.
            But ever-evolving technology has made blockchain, a revolutionary
            technology requires in almost every industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blockchain technology is decentralised, tamper-proof, easily
            accessible, easily traceable, trustless and a transparent system
            that will disrupt the supply chain management.
          </p>

          <h3>How will blockchain improve suppy chain management?</h3>
          <p>
            We can say that blockchain is a perfect solution to disrupt the
            current system of supply chain management.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every time the commodity will change hands, there will be a
            permanent record that will be stored in the blocks, this will create
            detailed information of the product right from the procurement of
            product till its point of sale. This will reduce the time consumed,
            human errors, and added costs.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What are the hurdles that the blockchain technology must overcome?
          </h3>
          <p>Blockchain will definitely improve:</p>
          <ul class="industry-list">
            <li>
              Recording and tracking of orders, receipts, change order and other
              trade-related details.
            </li>
            <li>
              The certification of the products could be easily verified and
              validated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Linking the codes of physical items to serial numbers, barcodes
              and RFID tags becomes easier.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Therefore, it is clear that this technology</p>
          <ul class="industry-list">
            <li>Will bring transparency into the system</li>
            <li>Will create a bigger and decentralised system</li>
            <li>
              Its immutability will overcome problems related to trust and
              corruption
            </li>
            <li>
              The system will be unhackable, hence, creating a safe and secure
              place for transactions.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Summing Up</h3>
          <p>
            Blockchain technology is the key to all the problems present in this
            system. However, it will take time to develop and overcome problems
            like currency volatility, spreading the knowledge on its technical
            know-how and people’s resistance to change.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the usage of blockchain opens up the doors for innovation and
            better use, we can hope that this system will be established as a
            norm in the management in this era of globalisation.
