          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            The concept of insurance has existed since ancient times. Almost
            every generation has used the insurance concept to control the
            effects of damage. Much has changed over the years; the development
            of technology has brought some major shifts in the present world,
            but the insurance sector remains backdated. Despite having various
            online insurance options, many people still prefer to work with
            agents and get insurance from them.
          </p>
          <p>
            As significant improvements are being made in the sector, the
            introduction of blockchain or a disruptive ledger is revolutionary.
            It uses advanced cryptographic techniques to create a safe and
            secure place for data that prevents window dressing and improves
            transparency.
          </p>
          <p>
            A blockchain can record anything from physical to digital assets;
            once a transaction is carried out, it is grouped and then protected
            in an online block that is available on a larger global network, to
            which only authorised parties have access.
          </p>
          <h3>The Advantages of Blockchain</h3>
          <p>
            The key advantage of introducing this technology is data security,
            and it can also create a clear audit trail. Also, as blockchain
            systems are unchangeable and does not require fault by any central
            authority, the use of a distributed ledger creates a new path for
            much more secured collaborations between competitors by removing the
            qualitative aspect of trust between third party organizations.
            <br />The other advantages are
          </p>
          <h4>Allieviating Paperwork</h4>
          <p>
            Insurances require a lot of red tape, which creates delays and makes
            the parties lethargic. The blockchain technology will speed up the
            process. It would not only create a hassle-free sign-up for the
            policyholder but also make the document verification process for the
            insurer easier.
          </p>
          <h4>Easy Claim Verification</h4>
          <p>
            Since everything is handled in real time, all the important dates
            related to the insurance would be updated in a timely manner. It
            will make the claim process simpler and smoother for both parties.
            Hence, a system would be developed where claims are managed,
            verified, and paid quickly.
          </p>
          <h4>Minimising fraud</h4>
          <p>
            When everything is online and in real-time, the chances of fraud are
            automatically reduced. No party can cheat on the other, and
            therefore, trust and goodwill are always maintained.
          </p>
          <h4>Ease in health Insurance</h4>
          <p>
            After the introduction of blockchain in the health sector, secured
            data like medical reports, charts, receipts, etc. can easily be
            shared between health providers and the patient. The same block data
            can also be made visible to insurance companies, and therefore they
            can keep track of their insurance holders. This will make the
            process of seeking and claiming such insurance easier.
          </p>
          <h4>General improvement of value chain</h4>
          <p>
            Once everything is updated regularly and even the customer has
            access to the same database, a flow of information and payments will
            ensue, and we can say that the blockchain technology will create
            value for both sides of the table.
          </p>
          <h3>Blockchain implementation issues in the insurance market</h3>
          <p>
            Though the idea is a win-win for both parties, its introduction in
            the market isnâ€™t easy, and the insurance is bound by many
            complications and legalities, making it completely cloud-based and
            block-based, which is risky. The blockchain technology still cannot
            overcome the legal and regulatory hurdles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving towards a blockchain-backed insurance industry can be a
            distant dream, but companies like Allianz and Swiss Re and various
            new start-ups are finding a solution. From the perspective of an
            industry as a whole, insurance companies have to align around
            standards and limitations within blockchain technology. While this
            system can provide insurers with better means for collaborating and
            sharing data, the insurers themselves should be willing to work
            together.
          </p>
          <p>
            The technology itself must also be further developed to overcome the
            existing hurdles. Public blockchains, where each transaction on the
            ledger is visible and accessible to everyone, are unfeasible for the
            industry due to privacy and security concerns. Private, active, and
            permissioned blockchains are yet to be developed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, the insurance industry is highly regulated to safeguard
            customers from misuse and cannot risk a breach of data. Legal and
            regulatory frameworks for insurance services need to evolve and
            provide a proper framework for this technology to be put into
            practise.
