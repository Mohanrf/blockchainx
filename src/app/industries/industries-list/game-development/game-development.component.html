            Mario video games in the year 1981 became very famous among game
            lovers by the name of Jumpman. In today’s world, Donkey Kong has
            become popular globally and is considered one of the most beloved
            games among Nintendo lovers. In fact, the game underwent many
            upgrades. Computer graphics have really won the hearts of millions.

            Graphics has gone beyond just technological advancements. With the
            growth of smartphone culture, mobile gaming came into view. Users
            started playing their favourite games even if they were at work. A
            researcher working for a blockchain technology company recently said
            that it can be better when you have your favourite game handy on
            your mobile phone. In the year 2018, Asia’s mobile gaming industry
            received an annual revenue of US$41.5 billion. Researchers claimed
            that the next step of the gaming industry revolves around blockchain
            technology. It is going to be far more profitable than what the
            industry has earned to date.

          <h3>
            The Potential of Blockchain Technology to Enhance Industry Profits
          </h3>
          <p>
            The gaming industry is not new to blockchain technology, but it is
            still in its elementary stages. There are various kinds of games
            built on blockchain technology that are earning a good deal of money
            in the current market. CryptoKitties is the most famous and demanded
            game on the blockchain network. CryptoKitties is an authentic game
            that allows players to purchase, breed, and trade digital kittens
            with the help of cryptocurrency. The game was launched in October
            2017, and it only took three months for it to earn a profit of $12
            million. The full version of the game was only available for a week.
          </p>
          <p>
            With blockchain technology, game developers are not the only ones
            who can take advantage of the system. The players can also earn
            profits. The game CryptoKitties allowed players to encash their
            tokens by selling their kittens to other players. Once the number of
            kittens doubles, the players can sell them to other players. Games
            such as this give away a place for the players to make money as
            well. Developers do not have the right to produce virtual money.
            Non-fungible tokens are authentic by their very nature. It is next
            to impossible to make an image of such tokens because they possess a
            unique address on the blockchain network.
          </p>

          <h3>How is technology beneficial to the gaming industry?</h3>
          <p>
            The game developers and the gamers are receiving vast benefits from
            the blockchain technology. The main problem with this technology is
            that there is a scarcity of unique circulation channels for the
            games stored in the network. Most of the games on the network are
            web games, but a large number of gamers prefer to play their
            favourite games using their mobile phones. The main problem is that
            Google Play and the Apple Store do not allow the circulation of
            mobile games that are cryptocurrency-based.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time. Blockchain technology is still in its growing
            years. It should not be forgotten that it is incapable of supporting
            a large number of transactions. Web games can easily let users play
            heavily stored games. CryptoKitties made a sale of $12 million, and
            soon after, the app crashed because it was unable to support so many
            users. Blockchain technology can be disastrous for non-crypto users.
            The user interface is not very pleasing. Moreover, only a small
            number of blockchain lovers are allowed inside the network. Using
            blockchain is not like flying a plane. It's something like PayPal
            while logging in. If you want to transact a certain amount, then you
            need to type in the person’s email ID, and it is done.
          </p>

          <h3>
            How to Overcome the Blockchain Technology Challenges in the Gaming
            Industry?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Disadvantages are higher than advantages within the blockchain
            network. Giving up hope is not the perfect solution. Yes, it is
            difficult for blockchain technology to support highly interactive
            games. Axie Infinity, a game almost as popular as CryptoKitties, has
            a lot more to discover and improve. People said that the blockchain
            technology was not speedy enough to play a game. Axie Infinity
            proved the statement wrong. In fact, it is a far more interactive
            game when compared with CryptoKitties. Game developers are trying
            their best to build games that go hand in hand with the blockchain
            technology. TomoChain has recently introduced TomoZ into the market,
            which will permit users to adopt decentralized applications. This
            can be done without having to purchase ETH or TOMO. Tomo X is
            another kind of protocol that allows gamers to deal in assets across
            various types of games. The best thing about the Tomochain network
            is that you do not require a third party.
          </p>
          <p>
            The network came into existence by the end of 2018, and now it has
            started to draw the attention of various game developers. It is not
            mandatory for them to know blockchain technology. The main aim of
            the network is to build a platform for gamers where they can play
            safely and securely.
