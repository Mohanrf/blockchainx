          <p>
            Blockchain technology is one of the most significant technologies
            that industries are willing to adopt. The healthcare industry is
            pretty much interested in blockchain technology because it leads to
            more effective research, more efficient processes, increased
            security, and better patient outcomes. Blockchain in healthcare is
            used for a variety of purposes, including protecting patient data
            and controlling the supply of pharmaceuticals.
          </p>

          <h3>How is Blockchain going to help the Healthcare industry?</h3>

          <p>
            Compared to other industries, the blockchain industry is developing
            very slowly. In today's fast-moving world, the processes followed by
            hospitals are antiquete. It has been often stated by researchers
            that the industry lacks technology. The statement is quite
            contradictory to the fact that some of the most educated and skilled
            professionals work in this industry. How can anyone state that the
            medical world lacks innovation all around the globe? Well, most of
            the innovations have been done in this industry, which in turn has
            increased the mortality rate and decreased the death rate. The world
            of medicine provides a new lease on life for humans. If you take a
            closer look at this industry, you will soon find out that it is
            filled with vertical modernization. When it comes to horizontal
            modernization, there is a slight delay.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What is the difference between vertical modernization and horizontal
            modernization?
          </h3>

          <p>
            Vertical modernization focuses on one particular aspect. Whereas
            horizontal modernization aims at fulfilling the desires of everyone.
            For example, Penicillin, the polio vaccine, and others help to
            diagnose a particular illness. This is an example of vertical
            modernization. On the other hand, cloud computing, electricity, and
            many others can be used in a wide variety of fields. This is a
            wonderful example of horizontal modernization. Many of the hospitals
            still prefer using pen and paper to jot down patient histories and
            other things. This indicates that they are still using vertical
            modernization, and it will take time for them to accept horizontal
            modernization.
          </p>

          <h3>How is Blockchain a Horizontal Modernization?</h3>

          <p>
            The data recorded in a blockchain remains unchanged and is handled
            by a network of computers. The computers are not owned by any
            individual or business firm. All the blocks of data are linked to
            one another and protected. The blockchain has gained immense
            popularity among businesses. This is because the processes followed
            by the blockchain are decentralized in nature, and there is no third
            party involved. The storage of data is cryptographic in nature. As
            the blockchain is unchangeable, no one has the right or access to
            get a hold of the data. The data stored in the blockchain can be
            stored.
          </p>

          <h3>How is Blockchain a Decentralized Process?</h3>

          <p>
            Decentralization is transparent in nature. Moreover, it builds trust
            in the minds of the users. In the earlier days, humans lived in
            caves for their survival. None trusted one another. When a human saw
            the chances of being killed while living in the wild, they learned
            to trust one another. Therefore, they started living in a community.
            With time, the trust factor evolved in a variety of ways. The barter
            system was our first system of exchange. It was not a very complex
            process. As time progressed, business became more complex. People
            began trusting banks rather than other individuals. As time moved
            on, banks started failing in their nature of business. The customers
            started losing faith, which ultimately led them to search for an
            online platform that would take care of financial transactions. The
            data accumulated inside the blockchain is stored in numerous storage
            spaces. Several computers operate within the network, which holds
            all the copies of the saved data. If anything is upgraded within a
            blockchain, then every node receives a notification for that.
          </p>

          <h3>Interoperability in the Healthcare industry</h3>

          <p>
            Interoperability is a complex situation in the healthcare industry.
            Over the years, patients as well as the authorities have faced
            serious complexity when it comes to interoperability. Recognizing
            patients is a conflicting situation when it comes to
            interoperability. In addition to this, the information remains
            blocked due to useless interoperability.
          </p>

          <h3>Dissatisfaction with recognizing patients</h3>

          <p>
            Since time immemorial, there has been no absolute guide to
            recognizing patients. International bodies have been working on this
            for decades now. So the healthcare authorities thought of
            introducing electronic health records for patients. Such a system in
            the earlier days led to ultimate chaos, and patients were left
            ill-treated.
          </p>

          <h3>Obstruction in the path of information</h3>

          <p>
            The blogging of data has caused chaos in the healthcare industry.
            When it comes to the healthcare industry, it is often said that
            obstruction in the path of information seems unreasonable.
            Information is blocked without any valid reasons. Blocking of data
            can sound reasonable when it comes to exchanging reports. The main
            reason behind the blocking of information is something else.
            Hospitals do not want to lose track of their patients. This is the
            main reason why they do not want to share their patient's details
            with another hospital, even though the patient has been referred
            there. On the other hand, researchers have claimed that data
            blocking by hospitals can be reduced. The entire process of data
            sharing must be kept transparent so that the data transferred can be
            tracked. A financial incentive is required for hospitals so that
            they start sharing data among one another.
          </p>

          <h3>Public Blockchains</h3>

          <p>
            Public blockchains are very common in nature. Blockchains like
            Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. are open to all. Moreover, a reward in the
            form of an incentive is provided to all the participants who take
            part. The blocks in these public networks do not have enough space.
            Moreover, Bitcoin has only a little more than 1 MB of space in each
            block. It isn't enough to carry on with the transactions as well as
            storing data for the healthcare industry. Moreover, Bitcoins cannot
            handle more than 7 to 8 transactions per second. This isn’t enough
            for the healthcare industry. If transactions in the healthcare
            industry are taking too long, then it can kill a person. The
            consensus mechanism is really important, but it is a waste of money
            for this industry. Lastly, medical institutes hold very crucial data
            in their systems. Why on earth would they want the data to be shared
            with any third party? Therefore, a public chain sounds impossible
            for the healthcare industry.
          </p>

          <h3>Private Blockchains</h3>

          <p>
            Every kind of user is allowed on a public blockchain. But this is
            not acceptable when it comes to a private blockchain. A user has to
            seek permission to gain access within the network. There is an issue
            with the participation of users. Users are restricted from entering
            the network even though they have the capability of doing so through
            an agreement. Participants are only allowed if they aren't new to
            the blockchain ecosystem, their control can be administered, and the
            user is an entity. Networks can be preserved as soon as any company
            enters them. Businesses benefit from joining a private blockchain.
            This includes confidentiality, boosted transactions, and a secured
            network.
          </p>

          <h3>Cryptographic Hash Functions</h3>

          <p>
            Transactions serve as input and are processed over a hashing
            algorithm, thereby producing an output of immovable breadth. This
            process takes place over financial platforms like Bitcoin. Being
            deterministic means it does not matter how many inputs you have
            passed through a hash function; the output remains the same. It
            would have been really hard to keep track of the different hashes
            produced every single time. Pre-image resistance states that it is
            really difficult to figure out the input with the help of the
            produced output. Though it is not entirely infeasible, the process
            is annoying and can spoil a lot of your time. The snowball effect
            claims that minor changes in the input can result in disastrous
            changes in the output.
          </p>
          <h3>Private chains are always better for the Healthcare Industry</h3>

          <p>
            If there's a hospital, then it would never inherit all the data of
            the patients. The data of the patients would be stored in the
            networks within the blockchain. The data will remain completely
            malware-free and protected. Every patient will be given an ID
            utilizing which they can be recognized. The blockchain technology
            can help the healthcare industry to share patient details and
            generate incentives within the industry. There would be no
            unnecessary blocking of the information. Significant questions have
            arisen: what if the information within the industry gets blocked?
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, blockchain technology has a solution for this as well. Users
            have permission to take a thorough look at their network. Blockchain
            technology is transparent. Individuals have full access to check
            whether their transaction is getting passed or not. When anyone
            tries to tamper with the data, then the snowball effect comes into
            effect. There is an exorbitant change in the hash.
          </p>

          <h3>
            How can the Healthcare industry benefit from using Blockchain
            technology?
          </h3>

          <p>
            The data stored within the blocks is unchangeable and can be
            recorded. Patients can now send their vital medical history to
            anyone else without fear of it being tampered with. Every patient
            detail stored within the blocks is completely protected. Patients
            now have access to check out which hospitals are using their data.
            Medical institutes can now have full access to the patient’s details
            stored within the blocks. Patients are rewarded through the reward
            mechanism for their appropriate behavior. For example, patients can
            receive tokens because they have followed the exact diet chart to
            stay fit and healthy. Various medical institutes can reward them
            using tokens as their data have served their purpose of research.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pharmaceutical businesses have to be very careful about their supply
            chain processes. Many drugs that are prohibited from being sold
            without a prescription from a doctor are stolen from the warehouse
            and sold illegally. The blockchain technology will help such
            companies ensure the smooth delivery of the medicines to their
            destination without them being stolen in the middle of the process.
            Every process can be tracked with the help of this kind of
            technology. Many medical institutes carry out research to ensure
            whether a particular drug is safe for human consumption or not.
            Using blockchain technology, a global database must be created so
            that research information can be used by other research centers in
            the future. Every patient receives insurance from the company by
            claiming it. Most of the time, the claim has been recorded as a
            fraud claim. With blockchain technology, fraud claims can be
            eradicated.
          </p>

          <h3>Criticisms</h3>
          <p>
            Though blockchain technology will help boost the healthcare
            industry, not everyone around us supports the authenticity of the
            technology. John Halamka, a critic who is familiar with the use of
            blockchain technology, is aware of both the advantages and the
            disadvantages. He mentions that the blockchain technology is not the
            right place to accumulate a large amount of data. The technology is
            not even apt for the reasoning. Apart from this, the transactional
            process is sluggish. Despite all these disadvantages, blockchain is
            a huge space where you can store your data without any tension.
            There is no chance of it being tampered with. This technology is
            flexible.
          </p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>

          <p>
            Blockchain technology has a wide number of advantages that have now
            been tried and tested by many industries. If the healthcare industry
            invests in this technology, then it can reach new heights. The main
            thing about this industry is that it doesn't lack money. There is a
            global investment of $8.734 trillion in the healthcare industry, and
            now the investment in the healthcare industry has reached new
            heights. In the year 2020, $7 trillion will be spent on the
            healthcare industry worldwide. The statistics on investment show
            that the industry does not lack money. It can comfortably carry out
            its research work for technological purposes as well. The future of
            the healthcare industry would be completely decentralized.
