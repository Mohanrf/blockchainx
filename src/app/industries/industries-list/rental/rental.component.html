          <h3>Overview</h3>

          <p>
            The property rental sector is much of ‘a pen and paper’ sector,
            where almost everything is done through a long chain of
            intermediaries and a lot of paperwork. The process of renting is
            time-consuming and tiring, but nothing has been done in the sector.
            This sector often relies on archaic methods for managing business
            and keeping records. Technology has now begun to reshape the process
            of globalization. Everyday, the IT sector is developing new
            technology faster and more reliably than the previous one. One such
            technology is the blockchain technology. Many sectors have
            discovered the sheer amount of positive utility of blockchain in
            their space.
          </p>

          <p>
            This technology is being evolved for various other sectors,
            including the rental sector. For this sector especially, it can
            prove to be revolutionary and solve many of its existing problems.
          </p>

          <h3>Issues faced in Rental</h3>
          <h4>Everyone's distant desire</h4>
          <p>
            Investments in real estate require a good amount of capital, which
            not everyone can afford. This sector has always had too many
            barriers like citizenship, credit scores, high interest rates,
            financing, etc.
          </p>

          <h4>Complete opaque way</h4>
          <p>
            This sector severely lacks transparency; there are depths of
            corruption and dishonesty in this business. A high degree of
            transparency is required to combat fraud cases, tax evasion, and
            money laundering.
          </p>

          <h4>Expensive Fees</h4>
          <p>
            A lot of intermediaries are involved in this sector, so at each
            level there’s a cost involved, making it super expensive. Fees like
            broker fees, transfer fees, attorney fees, investment fees, taxes,
            etc.
          </p>

          <h4>Lack of Liquitidy</h4>
          <p>
            Liquidity can be defined as the speed at which an asset can be
            turned into cash. Real estate is a fixed and long-term investment;
            nobody buys it with the intention of selling it in the future. They
            are very difficult to liquidate primarily due to ups and downs in
            the market, and there can be high chances that when a person is
            willing to sell their property, there might not even be a buyer.
          </p>

          <h4>Pricing Commitments</h4>
          <p>
            To invest in rentals, investors should have a lot of money up front.
            To keep the deal, they sometimes have to choose expensive financing
            options.
          </p>

          <h4>Transaction Speed</h4>
          <p>
            Real estate transaction speed may appear to be as simple as
            transferring one property to the name of another. But it actually
            consumes a lot of time, one can expect that they will find a
            suitable property in six months, but they definitely do require
            another six to complete the paperwork and payment procedures. Such a
            delayed process also results in a high fee structure.
          </p>

          <h3>How Blockchain can help with Rentals</h3>
          <p>
            In simple words, a Blockchain is a time-stamped series of immutable
            data stored in a decentralized ledger system that is accessible to
            all involved parties. The blockchain has the potential to transform
            the rental sector in many ways, but the primary benefits are smart
            contracts and tokenization.
          </p>

          <h4>Smart Contracts</h4>
          <p>
            Smart contracts are self-executing contracts. These automated
            contracts have a special system where there are specific
            instructions written in their codes, that are executed only when
            certain conditions are met. These contracts will cut off the
            middlemen and their share, making the process cheaper. This will
            also help in bringing transparency, as they cannot be tampered with
            or altered. It will also reduce the time consumed by paperwork in
            the whole process.
          </p>

          <h4>Tokenizaation</h4>
          <p>
            A Token is a digital representation of an asset, a value, or a
            function present in the real world. Blockchain technology will help
            create real-world tokens for the rental. Tokenization not only
            increases the liquidity of the asset but also helps in trading these
            assets without involving any third parties.<br />
            This will facilitate fractional ownership of property and save costs
            by excluding middlemen.
          </p>

          <h4>Better Financial Evaluation and Due Diligence</h4>
          <p>
            Physical paperwork and a manual verification process can involve the
            providers and are more likely to introduce errors in the process.
            Digitization of the process will make it cheaper, more secure, and
            more efficient, and will speed up the due diligence process.
          </p>

          <h4>Financing and Payment System</h4>
          <p>
            Due to the extensive documentation needs and the involvement of
            various intermediaries, the payment process is expensive,
            time-consuming, and opaque. Once the data is present on
            decentralized technology, it will become more transparent, have
            secure documentation and verification processes, decrease the number
            of involved parties, and make it more convenient for both the buyer
            and the seller.
          </p>

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            Though blockchains can help solve various problems, they still face
            many issues with their adoption, like Regulation, Scaling,
            Standardization and Widespread Adoption.
          </p>

          <h4>Regulation</h4>
          <p>
            The current environment is regulated by the government, financial
            institutions, and courthouses. Through digitization, there would be
            less control, and regulation can become tough.
          </p>

          <h4>Scaling</h4>
          <p>
            There are millions of transactions that take place. This technology
            cannot store much data. This is a major problem as it limits the
            number of transactions stored.
          </p>

          <h4>Standardisation</h4>
          <p>
            There are many blockchain technologies, but they are not
            interoperable. This results in a lack of standardization or
            interoperability.
          </p>

          <h4>Widespread adoption</h4>
          <p>
            As blockchain is still an emerging technology, most people do not
            fully understand its usage and applicability. The adoption of its
            technology will take a lot of time.
          </p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Though it seems that all the flaws prevailing in the rental sector
            can be covered by blockchain technology, it still has a long way to
            go to fully inscribe itself in the global system.
