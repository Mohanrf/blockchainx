                      <p>
                        The application of blockchain in government and public
                        services can solve the problems that have been haunting
                        the system for a long time.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Most people know blockchain as the foundation for
                        cryptocurrencies. But the technology has a much greater
                        potential that spans across almost any sector that you
                        can think of.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Governmental organizations all over the world were quite
                        skeptical about the technology. But that was because
                        they didn’t know much about this it.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Now, governments from different parts of the globe are
                        looking into the infinite possibilities of blockchain
                        technology.
                      </p>
                      <p></p>
                      <h2>What makes the system tick?</h2>
                      <p>
                        A democratic government is a system where people are
                        supposed to exercise the authority of the government.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The people who are citizens of a state elect their
                        representatives through an election process and these
                        representatives run the government on behalf of the
                        people.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In theory, the “people” are supposedly the ones with the
                        “power.” But in reality, the government often fails to
                        ensure even basic human rights to the citizens.
                      </p>
                      <h2>Where the system has slipped</h2>
                      <p>
                        The fact of the matter is that the government has a bad
                        name when it comes to public services. This makes
                        blockchain application in government the need of the
                        hour.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        People complain all the time about how inefficient
                        government offices are in processing requests and
                        sanctioning funds to the public.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But the roots of the problem go deeper than what we see
                        on the outside. The centralized system undoubtedly has
                        many disadvantages, which we will look at right now.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Lack of transparency</h3>
                      <p>
                        Lack of transparency in governmental affairs is
                        something that goes against the concept of democracy
                        itself. Yes, you have to keep some information
                        confidential, such as that of the military, to ensure
                        national security. But the system that is supposedly run
                        by the “people” forces its citizens to be unaware of
                        what happens around them.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We have to wait a whole year before we know what the
                        government has done with our tax money. And at times, we
                        even have trouble accessing our own personal
                        information.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        On a broader note, the lack of transparency leaves
                        little room for accountability. The big guys sitting at
                        the top get to decide between right and wrong while the
                        common man, who elected them, gets no control over the
                        government. This has forced people to lose faith in the
                        system and the situation only seems to be getting worse.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Inefficiency</h3>
                      <p>
                        Standing in line for a ridiculous amount of time and
                        running from door to door to get something done is a
                        regular sight in government offices.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This situation is aided by the fact that most government
                        employees consider their jobs as a safe zone. They get
                        all the benefits and a sense of authority as well.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        At the same time, many of the sectors have low wages
                        when compared to the expenditure of an average working
                        individual. This urges them to take bribes from the
                        public.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Moreover, almost all governmental programs need the
                        personal information of the public enrolling in it. And
                        while the government is taking steps to digitize the
                        process of records keeping and form filing, this job
                        still remains a painstaking one.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This is especially true with money transfers such as
                        fund sanctions, pension schemes, reimbursements, and
                        similar situations, where the person who needs the fund
                        has to change a few slippers before getting what’s
                        rightfully theirs.
                      </p>
                      <h2>Corruption</h2>
                      <p>
                        Well, perhaps this part needs the least explanation
                        because this is not a new tale to tell. Centralized
                        power almost always comes with consequences, and
                        corruption has plagued the system from the start. This
                        “disease” has infiltrated into almost every sector you
                        could possibly imagine, and from falsifying data to tax
                        frauds to using authority as leverage, corruption spans
                        across multiple sectors and almost every governmental
                        organization.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        However, this doesn’t mean that the government employees
                        are the only ones to blame. The citizens themselves play
                        a major role in fueling corruption.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        At the end of the day, everyone seems to be looking out
                        for themselves and for their own benefits. Instead of
                        collectively working for the betterment of a nation,
                        many people commit tax evasions, false insurance claims,
                        stage deaths for collecting social security, bribe
                        government officials for favors, and the list just
                        continues on and on.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Infringement of privacy</h3>
                      <p>
                        How safe do you think we really are? Our private data
                        is, in fact, one of the least private things that we
                        have.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The government knows everything about us and they
                        collect this information through various means.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        While this is not necessarily a bad thing as it would be
                        useful in case of a dispute, we don’t really know how
                        they use this information.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The way they do this snooping is quite interesting and
                        alarming at the same time. They hide the fact that they
                        are spying on us in the name of other services. It’s
                        really easy to even track what we do online and deduce a
                        behavioral pattern from it.

                      <h3>Mismanagement of resources</h3>
                      <p>
                        There is a huge mismanagement of resources in terms of
                        money and other resources happening across sectors.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The processes of the government take up a lot of time
                        and labor force, and this results in the spending of
                        money.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Many government officers forge fake bills for
                        reimbursements and take the money for themselves.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Moreover, the cost calculation for various government
                        projects is inaccurate. The funding is either too much
                        or too little. The money is being spent and there is no
                        real way of tracking it at all.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Lack of Digitization</h3>
                      <p>
                        Right about now, you might wonder, “Is this one really
                        relevant?”. Yes, the government has converted almost
                        everything into digital form. Most of the filing and
                        records keeping is done digitally through online
                        portals. However, this is not a fool-proof process.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Even though everything is done online, the public has to
                        provide information over and over again for enrolling in
                        each and every government scheme. If the data is
                        digital, then why can’t they just dig into the database
                        and retrieve it? This is one of the unanswered questions
                        that have been going around for a while now.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Network vulnerabilities</h3>
                      <p>
                        Almost all governmental organizations rely on legacy
                        networks for internal networking, and these are quite
                        slow when compared to other networking systems. The
                        organizations are slowly moving towards faster
                        solutions, but at this rate, it would take them several
                        years to transition into the future.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Furthermore, apart from being slow, these systems are
                        prone to security risks. What we need is a system that
                        gets the work done quickly and efficiently using the
                        latest technology.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Failing to ensure rights to citizens</h3>
                      <p>
                        The system has been largely incompetent in ensuring
                        rights to citizens. At times, these are basic human
                        rights that everyone deserves.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Time and again, we see that the elections come and
                        political parties make promises that they don’t keep.
                        Even the ones they do keep takes forever to take effect.

                      <h2>How Blockchain Solves These Problems</h2>
                      <p>
                        The problems at hand are indeed great, but thankfully,
                        there’s a way around.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Blockchain is a
                        <a href="https://www.blockchainx.tech"

                        >
                        that can solve some of the biggest problems in several
                        industries and sectors, including the government and
                        public sectors.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So, let’s take a look at how we can use blockchain to
                        revive the system.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Enforcing trust through trustless transactions</h3>
                      <p>
                        One of the major advantages of blockchain technology is
                        that you can guarantee trust between the government and
                        the people. Many widely use the term “trustless” when it
                        comes to blockchain and this can get a bit confusing.
                        What do they really mean when they say trustless?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In fact, blockchain is a technology that ensures trust
                        in all interactions and transactions. The word
                        “trustless” doesn’t mean that you eliminate trust. It
                        actually means that it reduces the amount of trust
                        required by everyone in the system. So, by
                        <a href="https://www.blockchainx.tech"
                          ><b
                            >implementing blockchain in government and public
                            services</b
                          ></a
                        >, you are actually establishing trust between the
                        government and the citizens.
                      </p>
                      <p>And here’s how.</p>
                      <h4>Smart contracts</h4>
                      <p>
                        Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the
                        terms and conditions of an agreement directly written
                        into the code. These programs are a fool-proof way of
                        carrying out tasks and always deliver results. For
                        example, let's say that you a retired person looking to
                        avail of their pension. In the current system, you’d
                        have to file your request at a government office and go
                        through a painstaking list of processes before the money
                        actually reaches your wallet. If we implement a smart
                        contract here, if you meet the criteria to avail the
                        pension, the contract will execute itself and you’ll get
                        everything you are owed instantly. Furthermore, since
                        there is no paperwork and no human mediator, no one can
                        interfere with the whole process.
                      </p>
                      <h4>Transparency with privacy</h4>
                      <p>
                        The information once stored on the blockchain database
                        can never be tampered with, and it will be available
                        whenever needed.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        You can store the public information on a public
                        <a
                          href="https://www.blockchainx.tech/hyperledger-blockchain-development"
                          ><b>blockchain ledger</b></a
                        >
                        that everyone can access. For example, criminal records
                        and employment records.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For sensitive information such as medical records, you
                        can store the data on a private distributed
                        blockchain-based ledger and make it available to
                        specified persons only.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This way the government can access the information they
                        need for providing services to the citizens while
                        ensuring rights to their citizens. The citizens get to
                        choose whether to disclose their private data or not.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Enhanced Security</h3>
                      <p>
                        Security is the number one feature of blockchain
                        technology. Hackers often target governments trying to
                        snoop into the citizens’ privacy and also to access
                        sensitive information. This information can be anything
                        from a person’s personal records to confidential
                        military plans.
                      </p>
                      <h4>Protection against hackers</h4>
                      <p>
                        Blockchain for government and public services add extra
                        layers of security that keep hackers away from the data.
                        When you use a distributed ledger for storing your data,
                        on a protected network, it becomes extremely difficult
                        for hackers to get into the system.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Usually, hackers only have to access one server to get
                        into the system. Blockchain, as the name suggests, is
                        made up of multiple blocks. And each block is connected
                        to all the blocks before and after it. For a hacker to
                        access the system, they would need to change the data on
                        a block as well as the data on every other block, to
                        avoid detection.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Moreover, the records on a blockchain ledger are
                        protected using something called cryptography. Each
                        entity that makes a transaction in the block gets a
                        private key assigned to the transactions they make. When
                        a hacker tries to make any changes to the data on a
                        block, this key becomes invalid and the peer connection
                        is notified instantly. This makes hacking practically
                        impossible.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        And unfortunately for the hackers, there is no single
                        point of weakness. The data itself is stored on multiple
                        databases and not on a single server.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Fighting corruption</h3>
                      <p>
                        Time and again, we hear stories of corrupt government
                        officials tampering with data to hide corruption or to
                        get benefits. Citizens even bribe these officials to
                        change the data.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Luckily, blockchain technology protects your data, not
                        only from hackers but from everyone, making falsifying
                        of data practically impossible. Additionally, since you
                        can use both public and private blockchains for storing
                        data, you can use authentication to choose who gets use
                        the data, while maintaining transparency by making
                        legitimate data available to the public in real-time.
                        What you see is literally what you get.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Elections</h3>
                      <p>
                        The elections have always been an issue all over the
                        world. In the era of ballots, security was a major
                        concern. Ballot boxes were guarded with high levels of
                        security to ensure that the votes were not forged.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Now, this process is done with the help of electronic
                        devices. But the problem here is that electronic devices
                        can be easily tampered with. We’ve heard several reports
                        of voters clicking on one candidate’s button and the
                        vote being cast for the other candidate.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Blockchain can eliminate this completely. With
                        <a href="https://www.blockchainx.tech"
                          ><b>blockchain application</b></a
                        >, we can ensure that each vote cast is authentic. And
                        the immutable storage guarantees that no data is ever
                        lost.
                      </p>
                      <h2>In A Nutshell</h2>
                      <p>
                        Blockchain for government and public services is a
                        revolutionary idea that can change everything for us. It
                        is effective not just in the public sector but also in
                        other sectors such as healthcare, insurance,
                        intellectual property, digital identity, food safety,
                        and the list just goes on.
