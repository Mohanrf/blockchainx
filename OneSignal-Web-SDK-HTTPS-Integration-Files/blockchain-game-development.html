                        Mario video games in the year 1981 became very famous
                        among the game lovers by the name of Jumpman. In today’s
                        world the Donkey Kong became popular globally and is
                        considered as one of the most favourite games of the
                        Nintendo lovers. In fact, the game underwent many
                        upgrades. Computer graphics have really won the hearts
                        of millions.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Graphics has gone beyond just technological
                        advancements. With the growth of the smartphone culture,
                        mobile gaming came into view. Users started playing
                        their favourite games even if they are at work. A
                        researcher working for a blockchain technology company
                        has recently said that what can be better when you have
                        your favourite game handy on your mobile phone. In the
                        year 2018, Asia’s mobile gaming industry received an
                        annual revenue of US$41.5 billion. Researchers claimed
                        that the next step of the gaming industry revolves
                        around blockchain technology. It is going to be far more
                        profitable than what the industry has earned till date.
                      </p>
                      <h4>
                        Blockchain technology can drive in profits for the
                        industry
                      </h4>
                      <p>
                        The gaming industry is not new to the blockchain
                        technology but it is still at its elementary stage.
                        There are various kinds of games built on the blockchain
                        technology which are earning a good deal amount in the
                        current market. CryptoKitties is the most famous and
                        demanded game on the blockchain network. CryptoKitties
                        is an authentic game which allows players to purchase,
                        breed and deal in digital kittens with the help of
                        cryptocurrency. The game was launched in October 2017
                        and only after three months, it earned a profit of US$12
                        million. The full version of the game wasn't kept live
                        for more than a week.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In the blockchain technology, game developers are not
                        the only person who can take advantage of the system.
                        The players can also earn profits. The game
                        CryptoKitties allowed players to encash their tokens by
                        selling their kittens to other players. Once the number
                        of kittens doubled in number the players can sell those
                        to other players. Games such as this give away a place
                        for the players to make money as well. Developers do not
                        have the right to produce virtual money. Non-fungible
                        tokens are authentic in its own nature. It is next to
                        impossible to make an image of such tokens because they
                        possess a unique address on the blockchain network.
                      </p>
                      <h4>
                        How is technology beneficial to the gaming industry?
                      </h4>
                      <p>
                        The game developers and the gamers are receiving vast
                        advantages from the blockchain technology. The main
                        problem with this technology is that there is a scarcity
                        for unique circulation channels for the games stored in
                        the network. Most of the games on the network are web
                        games but a large number of gamers prefer playing their
                        favourite games using their mobile phones. The main
                        problem is that the Google Play and the Apple Store do
                        not allow circulation of mobile games to the customers
                        which are cryptocurrency in nature.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        At the same time. The blockchain technology is still in
                        its growing years. The fact must be forgotten that it is
                        unable to support a vast amount of transactions. Web
                        games can easily let users play heavily stored games.
                        CryptoKitties made a sales of US$12 million and soon
                        after the app crashed because it was unable to support
                        so many users. Blockchain technology can be a disastrous
                        place for non-crypto users. The user interface is not
                        very pleasing. Moreover, only a small number of
                        blockchain lovers are let inside the network. Using
                        blockchain is not like flying a plane. Its something
                        like the PayPal while logging in. If you want to
                        transact a certain amount then you require typing the
                        person’s email id and it is done.

                        How to overcome the challenges of blockchain technology
                        for the gaming sector?
                      </h4>
                      <p>
                        Disadvantages are higher than advantages within the
                        blockchain network. Giving up hope is not the perfect
                        solution. Yes, it is difficult for the blockchain
                        technology to support high highly interactive games.
                        Axie Infinity a game almost same as the CryptoKitties
                        has a lot more to discover and improve. People said that
                        the blockchain technology is not speedy enough to play a
                        game. Axie Infinity proved the statement wrong. In fact,
                        it is a far more interactive game when compared with
                        CryptoKitties. Game developers are trying their best to
                        build games that go hand in hand with the blockchain
                        technology. TomoChain has newly introduced TomoZ into
                        the market that will permit users to adopt decentralized
                        applications. This can be done without having to
                        purchase ETH or TOMO. Tomo X is another kind of a
                        protocol which allows gamers to deal in assets across
                        various types of games. The best thing about the
                        TomoChain network is that you do not require a third
                        party.

                        The network came into existence by the end of 2018 and
                        now it has started to draw the attention of various game
                        developers. It is not mandatory for them to know the
                        blockchain technology. The main aim of the network is to
                        build a platform for gamers where they can play safe and
                        secured.
