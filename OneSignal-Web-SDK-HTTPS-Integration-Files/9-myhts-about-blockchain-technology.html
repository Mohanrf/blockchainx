                      <p>
                        Ever since the famous Bitcoin raised the urge for people
                        to trade with digital currency, there has been a
                        simultaneous escalation in the technology behind its
                        success. Blockchain thus became the recent muse of tech
                        freaks. This frenzy is now taking over the business of
                        existing entities in the web world to the next level by
                        promising a rock solid security system.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This strong security system is fuelled by the concept of
                        decentralised database. Traditionally, a network aways
                        holds its entire database in one place with single
                        authority which requires huge running power to maintain
                        and also makes it an easy target for hackers. To
                        eliminate this risk, Bitcoin used the decentralised
                        database or a distributed ledger system. In this method,
                        the data and its transaction history are stored in
                        unique Hash values which sits in a block and a series of
                        blocks are created to form a chain which is secured by
                        cryptographic principles. In this way, the ledger of a
                        blockchain is entirely distributed among its users or
                        peers in the network.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Each time a new transaction is made, a new block is
                        created and this has to be verified by a majority of
                        peers in the network to make it valid. Hence there is no
                        central authority and this makes it impossible for a
                        hacker to beat the systemâ€™s capacity to nullify the
                        security system. However, blockchain is widely
                        misconceived in certain facts that are taken for granted
                        when it comes to the underlying facts behind this famous
                        technology.
                      </p>
                      <p></p>
                      <h4>BLOCKCHAIN IS A DATABASE</h4>
                      <p>
                        Blockchain like any other technology, holds a database
                        in its system. But the fact is that Blockchain is
                        in-fact a DATA STRUCTURE. Furthermore, a typical
                        database is also a data structure that stores
                        information and is highly centralised. Whereas the data
                        structure of a blockchain is decentralised and has
                        distributed authority. So, depending upon the nature and
                        the use of a website, either database or blockchain has
                        to used.
                      </p>
                      <h4>BLOCKCHAIN IS DECENTRALISED</h4>
                      <p>
                        Blockchain is famous because of its security system
                        which routes back to a decentralised database or
                        distributed ledger system. But, this technology can be
                        structured either in a decentralised or centralised
                        method. Decentralised database is one of the two types
                        of blockchain. In this method the ledger is public and
                        accessible to all the peers in the network. While this
                        might not be necessary for all business nature, partial
                        transparency can be achieved in centralised private
                        blockchain where the access to the transaction ledger
                        can be limited to certain peers in the network.
                      </p>
                      <h4>BLOCKCHAIN IS ONLY P2P</h4>
                      <p>
                        There are three types of blockchain namely public,
                        private and hybrid. Of the lot, public blockchain is
                        most spoken of where the ledger is open to the peers in
                        its network. While this might not be practical in all
                        cases, blockchain technology doesn't necessarily have to
                        be a peer-to-peer network, as a Private Blockchain can
                        work with centralised database that doesnâ€™t require
                        peers. Whereas a hybrid can make the best combination of
                        the other two types.
                      </p>
                      <h4>BLOCKCHAIN IS ONLY FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY</h4>
                      <p>
                        Blockchain became extensively noticed because of
                        Bitcoinâ€™s fame, as it changed the business of digital
                        currency transaction.However, this technology can be
                        applied to a wide variety of industry applications like
                        finance, defence, retail and so on. Blockchain is only a
                        method that is used to eliminate the risk of hacking its
                        network for fraudulent dealing. Hence, this method can
                        be very useful in banking applications where a monetary
                        transaction can take place in a highly secure platform.
                      </p>
                      <h4>BITCOIN IS BLOCKCHAIN</h4>
                      <p>
                        Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency or digital currency that is
                        powered by Blockchain technology. Although, Bitcoin is
                        the reason behind blockchainâ€™s fame, it is simply an
                        application of blockchain which used the decentralised
                        ledger system to gain the trust of people in managing
                        monetary transaction in the most secure way. Ethereum,
                        another famous cryptocurrency, is also an example for
                        blockchainâ€™s application. Some famous companies using
                        blockchain are FedEx, IBM, Walmart, Microsoft etc.
                      </p>
                      <h4>BLOCKCHAIN IS MORE COMPLEX</h4>
                      <p>
                        As a technology, Blockchain can be easily build, but it
                        is misunderstood as complex because of Bitcoin as it
                        integrates many other technologies in the backend.
                        Blockchain is merely an open source technology which has
                        replaced the traditional intermediate transaction fee by
                        collective consensus theory which verifies the
                        transaction which accounts to a huge amount of security
                        and speed in the network.
                      </p>
                      <h4>BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTIONS TAKES MORE TIME</h4>
                      <p>
                        As Blockchain has distributed authority among its users
                        or peers it takes more time for transactions to be
                        validated. It uses a consensus algorithm which requires
                        the conformity of over 51% of its users to confirm and
                        validate a transaction or data that can be added to its
                        network as it uses peer-to-peer network in decentralised
                        method. This would mean that the peers spread across the
                        globe should be active to complete the process as quick
                        as possible. But if speed is a priority then Private
                        Blockchain can be used where the peers can be limited.
                      </p>
                      <h4>BLOCKCHAIN NEEDS MORE POWER</h4>
                      <p>
                        The same reason as to blockchain needing more time to
                        process a transaction or data due to its peer-to-peer
                        networking system, it also requires huge power backup to
                        validate the entry of new data through Consensus
                        Algorithm.For example, Bitcoin uses POW - proof of work
                        which takes time and take us a lot energy as it runs by
                        entire set of peers, but Ethereum uses POS - proof of
                        stake where a peer with higher stake can validate the
                        and confirm transactions making this a comparatively
                        quicker method.
                      </p>
                      <h4>FINAL THOUGHTS</h4>
                      <p>
                        After all, Blockchain is a new concept in the market
                        with very many interesting applications which will
                        resuscitate and revive some of the existing technology.
                        Although there are many misconceptions that prevail, it
                        can be easily sorted with a few examples. Understanding
                        this technology can go a long way in the days to come.
                        Hope this blog has cleared the air of confusion around
                        the concept of Blockchain.
